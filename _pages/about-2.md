I've worked in Universities for a while. Taking on a range of roles including teaching Information Technology (programming, operating systems, systems administration, software development), developing e-learning systems, lower-middle management and now teaching ICT integration to pre-service teachers. A tinkerer with a love for kludges and bricolage I've developed a few tools including the [BIM activity module][1] for Moodle and some insights into how University e-learning could be so much better. In particular, I have a strong prejudice against the techno-rational, analytical approaches to the provision and support of institutional e-learning/technology enhanced learning/learning (pick your label) as being completely inappropriate for the nature of the problem and the context. I'm increasingly interested in how the ideas of tinkering, bricolage, making, and [ateleological design][2] can be harnessed to improve learning and teaching. I'm currently playing around with these ideas around one of the current fads - [learning analytics][3]. 
### Current position {#current} In March, 2019 I migrated into a role as Learning and Teaching Consultant (Design) with the Arts, Education & Law group at Griffith University. The focus remains working with a raft of folk across the institution to help the institution and its members improve the quality of learning and teaching. A task that has a priority of improving the use of the institutional Virtual Learning Environment (which is defined as an approach reminiscent of 

[EDUCAUSE's NGDLE][4]). <!-- I work as part of the Office for the Advancement of Learning Teaching  at the University of Southern Queensland with the fancy position title of Associate Director, Educational Excellence and Innovation.Â  The focus of that job being on how to promote "academic development and learning, reward and recognition of good teaching, scholarship of learning and teaching and educational leadership development"

His current focus is on enabling teacher DIY learning analytics and exploring its impact on learning and teaching. -->

### On the land For a number of years my family and I have lived out of town on small farms. Much to our delight. We started with 100 acres at Nankin near Rockhampton. We lived in a 

[combination hut/caravan][15] which was constructed (under construction photos: [1][16], [2][17] by my father-in-law. There was a lovely view from the [front veranda][18]. Which also provided [some interesting times][19] when it rained a little bit more than normal. In May 2003 we moved to 240 acres in Struck Oil. One of the advantages of the move was having an [established house][20] with some rather [nice sunsets][21] and [other views][22] (e.g. [the feedlot in the mist][23]) and some local wildlife ([spiders][24] and [frogs][25]) In 2011 we moved to Toowoomba and eventually found a 10 acre property on the outskirts that has been home to the horses, cats, and dog.
