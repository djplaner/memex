# DJ's personal memex

An on-going experiment in creating and leveraging a personal memex using [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/). Some background on rationale and design.

Currently organised around a three step process

1. [[seek]] out new information
2. Make [[sense]] it
3. [[share]] artefacts.

And some [[work-todo]]

## Progress to date

See a list of blog posts for [my public descriptions and reflections on using Foam to develop memex](https://djon.es/blog/tag/memex/)

## To do

- [ ] Finish work on [[integrating-zotero-into-memex]]
- [ ] Explore better themes for memex
- [ ] Figure out a better structure than the current PKM focus
- [X] Get Google searching memex - done

And of course the on-going process
