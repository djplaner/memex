# DJ's personal memex

An on-going experiment in creating and leveraging a personal memex using [Foam](https://foambubble.githubio/). Some background on rationale and design.

Currently organised around a three step process

1. [[seek]]
   Nascent notes on the way into memex via various tools.
2. [[sense]]
   Notes that have been formally organised and connected into rambles.
3. [[share]]
   Various artifacts (being) produced from the notes.
