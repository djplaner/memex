# DJ's personal memex

An on-going experiment in creating and leveraging a personal memex using [Foam](https://foambubble.githubio/). Some background on rationale and design.

Currently organised around a three step process

1. [[seek]] out new information
2. Make [[sense]] it
3. [[share]] artefacts.
  
[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[seek]: seek/seek "Seek"
[sense]: sense/sense "Sense"
[share]: share/share "Share"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
