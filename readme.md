# DJ's personal memex

An on-going experiment in creating and leveraging a personal memex using [Foam](https://foambubble.githubio/). Some background on rationale and design.

Currently organised around a three step process

1. [Seek](seek/index.md)

  Nascent notes on the way into memex via various tools.

2. [Sense](sense/)

  Notes that have been formally organised and connected into rambles.

3. [Share](share/index.md)

  Various artifacts (being) produced from the notes.

## How it works 

As this is all new the following documents current methods to keep all this working (must to add)

- Publish to github

  VSCode - CTRL-P - Git Commit

- Create github issue (todo)

  VSCode - type _TODO_ into file and follow prompts

[todo]: todo "Todo"
