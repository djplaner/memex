# DJ's personal memex

An on-going experiment in creating and leveraging a personal memex using [Foam](https://foambubble.githubio/). Some background on rationale and design.

Currently organised around a three step process

1. [seek/index.md]
    
    Nascent notes on the way into memex via various tools.
2. [[sense]](sense)

    Notes that have been formally organised and connected into rambles.
3. [[share/index.md]]

    Various artifacts (being) produced from the notes.

[[tmp]]
