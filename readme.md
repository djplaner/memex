# DJ's personal memex

An on-going experiment in creating and leveraging a personal memex using [Foam](https://foambubble.githubio/). Some background on rationale and design.

Currently organised around a three step process

- [[seek]] 
    Tracking how and what new information I'm seeking.
- [[sense]]
    Where I try to make sense of the information.
- [[share]]

[seek]: seek/seek "Seek"
[sense]: sense/sense "Sense"
[share]: share/share "Share"
