# Orchestration

> We define orchestraiton as the real-time management of multi-plane scenarios under multiple constraints (Dillenbourg et al 2018, p. 181)

## Origins of orchestration

Dillenbourg et al (2018) link it to CSCL and the rise of collaboration scripts
> The goal of collaboration scripts is to structure the tasks or tools assigned to teams in a way that maximizes the probability that productive interactions emerge (Dillenbourg & Hong, 2008). Productive interactions are interactions that produce learning effects such as conflict solving, explanation, argumentation, or mutual regulation. (p. 180)

Define micro (internal to an activity) and macro scripts (sequence and transition between activities).  Macro script==classroom script

## Design principles for orchestration

Cuendet et al (2013) cited in Dillenbourg et al (2018) p. 183
- Empowerment: giving the classroom control to the teacher, as illustrated by the orchestration cards.  
- Awareness of the learner states: for instance, with the tangible interface for logistics, the teacher could see what is happening at every classroom table more easily than if learners were using tablets.  
- Flexibility: the ability to change the pedagogical scenario on the fly.  
- Minimalism: applies to both information provided to teachers and functionalities (e.g., with a dashboard that can be read at a glance).  
- Integration: a workflow that carries data across planes and activities (e.g., the team warehouse designs are collected in the teacher dashboard).
