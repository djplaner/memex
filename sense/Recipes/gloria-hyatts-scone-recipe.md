# Gloria Hyatt’s scone recipe

> Makes 12-18 (depending in the size of your scone cutter)
> 1 egg
> 4 tablespoons of oil (she uses vegetable oil)
> 2 cups of milk (or 1½ cups milk and half a cup of sour cream or thickened cream)
> 4 cups of self raising flour
> 1 teaspoon salt
> 1 tablespoon sugar
>
> Beat the egg, oil and milk until combined. Sift the flour, sugar and salt into a bowl. Add the egg mixture to the flour. Knead until just combined and then turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Pat into a flat shape of the thickness you'd like your scones. Hyatt prefers ¾ inch. Cut with a floured scone cutter and then place on a greased tray. Cook at 220 degrees for 12 to 15 minutes.
