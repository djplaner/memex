# Convivality

Ivan Illich - _Tools for Convivality_

> "I choose the term "conviviality" to designate the opposite of industrial productivity.
>
> "...Tools foster conviviality to the extent to which they can be easily used, by anybody, as often or as seldom as desired, for the accomplishment of a purpose chosen by the user.
>
> "...The crisis can be solved only ... if we give people tools that guarantee their right to work with high, independent efficiency, thus simultaneously eliminating the need for either slaves or masters and enhancing each person's range of freedom. People need new tools to work with rather than tools that "work" for them.
