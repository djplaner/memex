## Five ways people can adapt to automation and intelligent machines

Harold Jarche [summarises](https://jarche.com/2017/02/only-humans-need-apply-review/) from [Only Humans Need Apply](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062438611/) (from Thomas Davenport) idenetification of five ways (stepping) that people can adapt to automation and intelligent machines
- Step-up: directing the machine-augmented world (creativity) 
- Step-in: using machines to augment work (deep thinking) 
- Step-aside: doing human work that machines are not suited for (empathy) 
- Step narrowly: specializing narrowly in a field too small for augmentation (passion) 
- Step forward: developing new augmentation systems (curiosity)

And adds the following image, perhaps helping locate the work we're doing.
