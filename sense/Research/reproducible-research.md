# Reproducible Research

From this [Curriculum Development Hackathon](https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/RR-Jupyter-Hackathon-Jan-2017/blob/master/Call-for-participation.md) for using Jupyter Notebooks
> As science becomes increasingly more data and computation intensive, maintaining the ability to build on our own or otherâ€™s prior work requires that the process that takes data and other inputs all the way to the results presented in a paper is documented and made available in full detail. The concept of reproducible research means that someone else should either be able to obtain the same results given all the documented inputs and the published instructions for processing them, or if not, the reasons why should be apparent from comparing the executed processing steps to the documented ones.
