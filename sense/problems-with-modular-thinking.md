- [ ] Look at quote from other paper I was reading (Zotero faile)

*Define modular thinking*

> Working on individual parts of the system does not improve the functioning of the whole: Because in a system, it is not so much the parts that matter, but their fit.
> What really improves a system as a whole is working not on the parts itself, but on the interactions between parts. 
> Systems are not improved by tinkering with the parts, but by working on their interactions.
