## Views on Digital Transformation

### [[skills-framework-for-the-information-age]] - [(SFIA) Digitial transformation - skills at a glance](https://sfia-online.org/en/sfia-8/sfia-views/digital-transformation?path=/glance)

Four categories - giving a view more at the organisational level, than individual

1. Digital strategy innovation and investments
2. Digital culture, skills and capabilities
3. Digital & data transformation, change and governance
4. Digital technology enablers

These go into some detail, but none includes any form of software development. Even the technology enablers are system design, service support, user experience evaluation, data science, machine learning, requirements definition and management.  Moved into boxes that are perhaps less than the sum of the whole.
