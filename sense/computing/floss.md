# FLOSS and FOSS 

See also: [[computing]]

[[FLOSS]](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html) is a somewhat contested term for talking about the various perspectives on open source software - Free-Libre and Open Source Software.

A key distinction is the use of the French/Spanish word _libre_ to emphasise "free" as in _freedom_ not the absence of cash cost.
