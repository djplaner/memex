[Team Topologies](https://teamtopologies.com/) is an "approach to organising business and technology teams for fast flow" an "adaptive model for organisational design and team interaction"

"effective software teams are essential for organisations to delivery value"

> Four fundamental types of team and three core team interaction modes combine with awareness of Conwayâ€™s Law, team cognitive load, and responsive organization evolution to define a no-nonsense, team-friendly, humanistic approach to building and running software systems. 

## Four teams

### Stream-aligned team

- Focused on a single, impactful stream of work (single product, set of features, user journey, user persona)
- empowered to delivery customer value ASAP, no hand-offs
- closer to the customer and typically agile
- incorporates customer feedback in development cycles, while maintaining software in production

### Platform team

- Enable stream-aligned teams to work with substantial autonomy by providing internal services
- May support multiple stream-aligned teams

### Complicated-subsystem team

- Builds and maintains any part of the system requiring specific skills/knowledge
- aim to reduce the load of stream-aligned teams

### Enabling team

- specialists in a given technical/product domain that help stream-aligned teams by researching, learning new skills
- focused on research and experimentation
