See also: [[floss]], [[hacker-ethos-collective-intelligence]]

Summary and reflections on [_Floss, A partial antidote to social catastrophe](https://tjex.net/blog/2023/floss-a-partial-antidote-to-social-catastrophe/) with the structure 

## Summary

### What is the problem?

- Software embedded in all we do 
- But neoliberal drivers mean there are numerous issues 
- In this context, just adding more technology isn't going to help. 

### What is FLOSS?

- short description of FLOSS versus FOSS

### What is the common alternative to FLOSS?

- Links to issues with capitialism contributing to rise of monopolies
- Limitations of regulatory environment an issue
- Some examples from tech
- Nice quote 

> When Richard \[Stallman\] called it slavery, it wasn't a metaphor. It was simply an archaic political term for what it is like living in a world in which machines that you can't understand and you can't modify and you can't do anything about, control you and everybody else." - Eben Moglen, [Coding Democracy](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262542289/coding-democracy/)

- Facebook has two critical assets 
    1. _Secrecy_ of their algorithms.
    2. Restricted _interoperability_ with their services

### How does the public stand to benefit from FLOSS?

- Draws on benefits of [[commons-based-peer-production]] as a starter using Wikipedia as the "case study"
- Of course, doesn't mention the difficulties of encouraging significantly representative levels of collective engagement

### A Focus on Communication
### A New Hope
