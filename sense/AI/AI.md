## About LLMs

- [[llm-types]] - over of different LLM types
## Presentations 

- [[building-ai-applications-based-on-learning-research]] - Q&A with Khan Academy on their use of LLMs

## Prompt engineering

- [[prompt-engineering]]
- [[prompt-engineering-for-educators]]

## Explorations

- [[first-llm-api-experiments]] - Figure out how and if basic APIs for LLMs can be used to "template" prompt engineering

- [[customising-llms]] - if and how do you customise a LLM using your own documents.

## Questions and resources for further exploration

- If, why and how to run a LLM locally - would generally require a good set of content to train it with???
