# Pathway planner

Docs for the development of the pathway-planner component.

## To do

- [X] Create repo - code/griffith/2020/pathway-planner
- [ ] Decide on "look and feel" - [material](https://material.io/develop/web/docs/getting-started)
> There's a [choice here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57752189/material-web-components-vs-material-components-web) between Material Web Components and [Material Components Web](https://material.io/develop/web)
> But the mwc stuff. Which is working.  Is still beta. But it is the wrapper around the former.
- [ ] Implement "look and feel" within shadow dom
- [ ] Revisit the react version
- [ ] Plan out the structure of web component version
- [ ] Implement hard wired initial version

## Resources

- [open-wc codelabs #2](https://open-wc.org/codelabs/basics/lit-html.html?index=/codelabs/#2)
- [open-wc code examples](https://open-wc.org/developing/code-examples.html) - good collection of short examples
- [Building componets (Google)](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/)

### Interface decisions and information

[Material Components Web (mdc)](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web) - help developers implement Material design.

[Material Design Web Components (mwc)](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web-components) - are a wrapper around MDC to create custom elements (web components)

- install component via npm
- import into web component (all css applied)

## Implement look and feel within shadow development

Web components often use the shadow DOM (by default?). Meaning it's hidden away. External CSS doesn't impact it?



## Insights

[Reactive property changes](https://open-wc.org/codelabs/basics/lit-html.html?index=/codelabs/#7) use properties and immutable approaches - create new arrays etc

[setting property syntax](https://open-wc.org/codelabs/basics/lit-html.html?index=/codelabs/#9)
