# SvelteKit and Github pages 

See also: [[foam-dev]]

## Experiment #1 - Simple combination

Using [these instructions](https://github.com/shinokada/sveltekit-githubpages) to work with [this repo](https://github.com/djplaner/svelte-ghpages-test)

Basic setup process

1. Set up SvelteKit project using standard process
2. Add the static adapter - way to generate static files from SvelteKit - specific to gh-pages

	Note: need to remove the existing adapter import
3. Modify the projects config file to use the static adapter
4. Modify the layout
5. Modify the package.json

To deploy `npm run gh-pages` based on changes to package.json

The original repo used `routes/+page.svelte` as the static content that was created

And that works.
