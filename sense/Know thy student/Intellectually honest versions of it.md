# Intellectually honest versions of it

From a common on [this post](https://computinged.wordpress.com/2019/01/21/standards-are-limiting-and-long-lasting-alan-kay-was-right/) Alan Kay shares a quote from Jerome Bruner that he is "a bit enthusiast about"

> *for every learner you can (and need to) find an intellectually honest version of a subject they can learn if you heed their level of development

[This page](http://infed.org/mobi/jerome-bruner-and-the-process-of-education/) reveals the following quotes from Bruner

> We begin with the hypothesis that any subject can be taught effectively in some intellectually honest form to any child at any stage of development. (ibid.: 33)

Which [this] by Steve Wheeler talks about Bruner's work on the scaffolding of learning. Links Bruner's work with Vygotsky and the Zone of Proximal Devellopment
