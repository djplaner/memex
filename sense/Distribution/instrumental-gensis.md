# Instrumental Genesis

How does a tool become something that is used by someone to achieve a meaningful task? How does a tool become an instrument?

What are the rules for applying a tool to a task? Why/how does that application become meaningful to the user?

Instrumentalisation - the act of a tool becoming an instrument - is a dialectical interplay between understanding the tool and how it relates to the context of the required task.

A process which changes the person as they develop the knowledge/skill required to use the instrument.

## Explanation

White (2008) 

> Verilon and Rabardel's (1995) account of instrumental genesis, the process through which artifacts become tools to be utilized in the accomplishment of a task (p. 3)

The instrument

> represents the union of an objective artifact, such as a physical device or software component, with a particular user's conceptual scheme for implementing the artifact in a specific activity situation

> Instruments thus emerge through a dialectical interplay between the technical demands of mastering a device and the conceptual work of making the device meanirgful in the context of a task

> Through **instrumentalization**, an artifact becomes a means of achieving an objective, solving a problem, completing a task - it becomes meaningful to an activity situation, and thus has been transformed into an instrument.

> _instrumentation_ involves forming a **utilization scheme** that provides a predictable and repeatable means of integrating artifact and action

**utilization schemes** include both

- rules/heuristics for applying an artifact to a task; and,
- understanding how that application becomes meaningful to the user.

**theorems-in-action** "specify the knwoeldge underlying a particular scheme"
