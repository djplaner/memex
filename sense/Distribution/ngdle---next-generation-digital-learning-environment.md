# NGDLE - Next Generation Digital Learning Environment

[EDUCAUSE define the NGDLE](https://www.educause.edu/ecar/research-publications/foundations-for-a-next-generation-digital-learning-environment-faculty-students-and-the-lms/ngdle-the-wave-of-the-future) as
> a digital learning architecture encompassing a confederation of learning applications, tools, and resources woven together by means of open standards.

In part, because of the inherent variety
> What is clear is that postsecondary learning is far too diverse to be enabled adequately by a single application or platform.  Therefore, it seems legitimate to conclude that any LMS will always need to be supplemented by additional components and resources, resulting in a digital learning environment instead of an LMS platform.

Raising the question of who decides what supplements are allowed?
