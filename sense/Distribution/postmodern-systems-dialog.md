Drawing on ideas of post modern and post structuralism - as applied to distributed systems

Picks up Sussman's critique of systems design.  Resonates with much of the work here 


## Post modern philosophy

Lyotard - "incredulity toward metanarratives"

Paul Cilliers

> The postmodern condition is characterised by _the co-existences of a multiplicity of heterogeneous discourses_ - a state of affairs assessed differently by different parties

Reject universal explanations common to modernity.

A mode of thinking that recognises diversity and tries to understand through multiple perspectives.

System design relies on simple representations.
