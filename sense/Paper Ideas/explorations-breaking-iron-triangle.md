# Breaking the iron triangle

## Idea

Idea for an abstract/paper for Theta'2022

- Intro the iron triangle as applied to design for learning
- incresingly important in a COVID and post-pandemic context for higher education to find out ways to break this iron triangle - more quality, more flexibility, reduced cost
- Paper reports on explorations from GU using combinations of alternate theoretical conceptualisations of educational technology, entangled pedagogy etc...and contemporary technologies such as RPA, web components and citizen development
- Talk about the outcomes - widespread adoption of the Card Interface

Ryan et al (2021) 

- establish key issue as maintain quality while at scale ([[iron-triangle]]) not even taking into account increasing scope due to COVID
- identify "Offloading administrative and technical support" as a method for dealing but focus on "learner support" thru "smart" tools. Apparently ignoring the idea of providing tools and processes that actively help with the challenge of teaching


## Abstract

Already facing massification, reduction in funds, with COVID higher ed is facing increasing need for flexibility and scope (micro-credentials etc)


## Ideas

Downes pulls apart ALT ethical framework, including priority given to the autonomy of others

### Dx

[EDUCASE's Dx push](https://www.educause.edu/showcase-series/how-dx-powers-the-post-pandemic-institution?utm_source=sendgrid.com&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=website)

Some of the [same drivers](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xlJ9YL7hnrlqJU_gZVqlukQyDxpeiHai/edit#slide=id.p3)
- The pandemic
- Pervasive adoption of technology across colleges and universities
- New expectations about technology from students
- Increased skepticism about higher education
- Reduced public funding
- Advances in technology
- Increased emphasis on data as institutional strategic asset
- …and many other factors

Largely the [same intended outcomes](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xlJ9YL7hnrlqJU_gZVqlukQyDxpeiHai/edit#slide=id.p6) that drive student success
- Improving the student experience
- Improving retention
- Improving faculty teaching and advising
- Improving students’ course performance
- Reducing students’ time to completion

And mentions some other potentially important points
- Involves a foundational shift such as changes to the underlying business model and approach
- Requires changes that are holistic in nature
- Enables an institution to differentiate itself
- Involves continuing effort–it’s not a “once and done” solution
- [Areas of impact](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xlJ9YL7hnrlqJU_gZVqlukQyDxpeiHai/edit#slide=id.p11) **Shift from risk avoidance to risk management** though I imagine IT guys interpret this differently than I
- AoI - **New levels of cross-organisational collaboration** - Ellis & Goodyear - activity systems could fit here.
- AoI - **Rapid decision-making adaptation to changing circumstances and new opportunities** allowing local change, CAS et

But seems mostly focused on what management does. Defined [actionable steps for campus leaders](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xlJ9YL7hnrlqJU_gZVqlukQyDxpeiHai/edit#slide=id.p12) end up with
- Define transformation goals and set up matrixed response teams to execute on transformations

No description (yet seen) of how and what transformations those teams work on. Also has heavy focus on key institutional goals and ambitions.




### Against User Centered Design - more systems

[Beyond the lens of UCD](https://alexis.medium.com/camera-obscura-beyond-the-lens-of-user-centered-design-631bb4f37594) makes three points against UCD, including "obscuring possibility"

### Learning technology and COVID

[How learning technology can help?](https://educationimp.wordpress.com/2021/09/16/how-learning-technology-can-help/?utm_source=sendgrid.com&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=website)

Description of technologists involvement in generating a Scottish Government report around COVID. With a particular focus on what it says about learning technology.

With particular quotes/recommendations including
- "Institutions will need to explore increased support for teaching staff"
  Which doesn't mention anything about "multi discplinary teams to support learning"  
- "We expect institutions to explore internal efficiency measures, for example, increasing class sizes, reducing the percentage of income spent on staffing, ensuring support staff arrangements are appropriate to the size of the institution..."

The author concludes
> What started with the Scottish Government looking for ways to utilise support staff expertise in the development and delivery of online & blended learning ultimately narrows to educators having to take on more responsibility, and support staff being cut....Or perhaps more likely a middle ground, where the use of multi-disciplinary teams of subject specialists, learning techs/developers, admin & IT all come together to deliver teaching and support learning?

Highlighting the failed focus on the activity system/ecosystem?

[Response to the above](https://educationimp.wordpress.com/2021/09/19/response-to-how-learning-technology-can-help/) a follow up blog post that distills a twitter thread of responses.  

Highlighting different perspectives, including the challenge of educators wanting some sense of ownership of their work and also the challenge of clashes of perspective/purpose/goal
