# Changing interactions to improve L&T 

## Spark

Formal institutional L&T is a complex system. Change in complex systems is best achieved by changing the interactions in preferred ways. Rather than specifying desired outcomes.

If/how can the gathering/weaving/augmenting idea be used to use this idea to improve L&T in concrete/contextual ways?

## Thinking

Snowden's approach to "design thinking" is

1. Choose a scaffolding 
2. Define your objects (including people)
3. Define your interactions
4. See what emerges - respond appropriately

In particular, with software don't automate early. Have people interact with the software and once stability emerges, automate it hen.

> **design as the emergent property of the interaction of multiple objects around scaffolding over time with further automation and structure of stable patterns as they emerge**
> **It's ecological design. It's not engineering design. You're designing an ecosystem which also means you're open to novel forms emerging which you couldn't have anticipated**

## Changing Interactions

(Snowden, 2023)
> I'm changing the way that people interact so that they see things differently are not actually telling anything about what sort of behavior I want and just changing the way that people act and this is a key thing on complexity theory of change we never talk about desired behaviors we talk about changing interactions so that the behaviors will emerge which by the way I think is more ethical


## Scaffolding


(Snowden, 2023)
> this is a new type of design which is actually more cost efficient but it requires distributed decision making and we've done a lot of work on that lately and distributed decision making is not the same thing as delegated decision making that's a really important difference 

> yeah so you choose a scaffolding you define your objects and you define your interactions and you see what emerges and the way we're moving on this on software design at the moment is say people are objects too you could probably get software out a lot faster if you had human objects which interacted with the software objects around scaffolding and once you get sufficient stability you might automate things but you don't automate everything up front because human beings can actually handle judgment in different ways so effectively that's starting to talk about design as the emergent property of the interaction of multi-type objects around scaffolding over time with further automization and structure of stable patterns as they emerge and this deals with things which can't be known until you deal with it it's ecological design it's not engineering design yeah you're designing an ecosystem which also means you're open to novel forms emerging which you couldn't have anticipated but may be more useful instead
