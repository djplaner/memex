# Exploring conceptions of technology: Implications for learning, teaching, and meso-level practitioners

## Abstract

It appears likely that the post-COVID landscape for learning in tertiary education will entail more widespread adoption, conversion and transformation or practice through educational technology. 
-	Meso-level practitioners are currently seen as important to enabling this greater use of educational technology
-	But what is educational technology? There is significant research literature suggesting that current conceptions of educational technology are practically and theoretically limited/naïve and under theorized. 
-	Different theoretical conceptions promise to provide productive lenses through which to make sense of and plan for how and what to do in this educational technology rich post-COVID landscape
-	This paper uses a particular theoretical conception of educational technology to look anew at the experiences before and during COVID of a group of meso-level practitioners. It uses that analysis to tentatively suggest some implications for useful practices in the post-COVID landsape.

## Introduction

[[covid-response-digital-learning]]
COVID led necessarily to the widespread adoption of digital technology. Talk about why and what was done.

[[covid-ed-dev-contribution]]

Meso-level practitioners – like everyone else - were busy during this stage. Define these roles e.g. (Aitchison et al., 2020) educational developers. Draw in some of the literature from before and during COVID times.

[[covid-response-outcomes]]

The outcomes weren’t that great. Students are aching to get back on-campus. Student satisfaction dipped. Workloads were high. Outcomes were not great. Exam proctoring. Etc.

What could/should the post covid landscape look like? How can MLPs help? Post-COVID there is a need to improve. To think anew.  E.g. Microsoft

[[theory-and-technology]]

Theory is a way to think anew. It’s practical. But under utilized, both in the literature and in practice.
Long been interest in theorization of technology and educational technology. Touch on these. Post-digital. Critical. Illich. Franklin.

Make the case why doing this is relevent.  The hole in how things were responded to. But going beyond simlar reporting, but on ed designers doing personal reflection with theory. Not the only theory, or the best theory but a different theory that may contribute useful insights

Research question: What might different conceptions imply for learning, teaching and meso-level practitioners in a post-COVID landscape?

This paper uses a particular theory of educational technology to analyse the experiences of X meso-level practitioners before and during COVID. More on research method.

Summarise the paper

## What is educational technology?

Introduce and explain Dron’s take on educational technology

Use the room example

Lead up to the following summary

The orchestration of phenomena for a purpose

Establish this definition as the main lenses that will be used to analyse our experiences below

## Purpose

### Purpose, context and unhelpful pedagogy/technology binaries

Calls to put pedagogy before technology – unhelpful binary – Dron’s take mirrors (Fawns, 2020) (context+purpose) drives pedagogy which includes use of technology 

Perhaps definitional. But

Dron’s definition can be seen to mirror the move away from binaries to relational – Bigum, Goodyear, Fawn etc. Long established that 

Illustrate this from our practice.  Colleagues driven by pedagogical concerns e.g. constructive alignment, a type of technology, lets start by revisiting the learning outcomes. Rather than being driven by purpose/context of project.

Illustrations
-	Reality that hard technologies (timetabling etc) actually do come first and constraint what is possible.

Some of those assemblies are quite hard. E.g. lecturer in job title. Timetabling system UA Chief Executive Catriona Jackson explaining (Zhou, 2021)

“When universities do their timetables and their curriculum, they do them months out,” she says. “Really strict lockdown requirements were very much in force in December and January. They made those curriculums in December and January. You cannot change a curriculum mid-term. You just can’t.”


### What is the purpose of universities?

(Macgilchrist et al., 2019) and the three future ‘histories’ of education. More commercial
Matching surveys work of MLPs (Aitchison et al., 2020) showing a move away from developing people to developing products.

Touch on the difficulty MLPs have in making any change in that outcome.

Illustration?

### Purpose proxies and purpose pushers

Dron’s take is that the individuals involved in learning tasks bring and work toward their own individual purposes. Arguably that the best work is done helping with those specific purposes

Jasmine Huang, Kelly Matthews and Jason Lodge (all Uni Queensland) make this clear in a study of staff experience when management of an unnamed Australian university rolled out 16 large-enrolment blended-learning courses in 2019. Staff involved, “perceived institutional drivers for blending to be misaligned towards indiscriminately translating all courses, necessary or not, to an online format akin to a polished massive open online course product” the authors report (CMM May 28).

Illustrations
-	Professional bodies requiring “certification” of student’s own work (almost) requiring use of exam proctoring software
-	Institutions who focus more on establishing outcomes – graduate attributes, course design standards etc – rather than knowing how to help individuals orchestrate pheneomena for their own purpose
-	Project and product managers
-	

## Phenomena

??Should phenomena go last?? The idea being that it's the thing current practice tends to focus most on, rather than on orchestration (broadlly defined)

### The (im)possibilities of modality agnostic and phenomena independent

The idea of HyFlex and others suggesting that L&T should be prepared in modality independent ways. (Turnbull et al., 2021)

Perhaps link to (Stokoe, 2021) and similar points about in-person and online being very different phenomena. But also link to the point below about conversation of complexity. i.e. harnessing certain phenomena have a lot of “libraries” collected together to help.

### Hidden elephants ?? hard, implicit phenomena

Idea that ??? something about how we don't even see these things??

### Is training the only solution?
### Primitive assemblies of technologies / Conversation of Complexity

The lack of digital fluency amongst students and especially staff have often been idenetified as a factor limiting the quality of online learning and teaching. (horizon report) Common recommendations has been the provision of e-learning training support for faculty (Turnbull et al., 2021) but…

Phenomena are assemblies of other technologies. Over a long history unviersities have developed quite complex assemblies of technologies designed to support face-to-face learning and teaching.  Very different modes require different assemblies of technologies. What

-	Blank canvas that is the LMS
-	The CYO studios being great assemblies for producing video, but little advice about what to do next? Or about design and broader considerations.

## Orchestration

### Which University account are you using?

Best of Breed versus integrated system. #ngdle/VLE.  Fragmented digital learning experiences

Illustrations
-	Unable to access Stream and other O365 resources, even though you’re logged in.
-	PebblePad language/conceptions being very difficult
