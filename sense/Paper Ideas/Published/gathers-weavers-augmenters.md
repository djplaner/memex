# Gathers, Weavers and Augmenters: Three principles for dynamic and sustainable delivery of quality learning and teaching

Resources related to THETA'2023 conference presentation

## Abstract

The pandemic reinforced higher educations’ difficulty responding to the long-observed challenge of how to sustainably and at scale fulfill diverse requirements for quality learning and teaching (Bennett et al., 2018; Ellis & Goodyear, 2019). Difficulty increased due to many issues, including: competition with the private sector for digital talent; battling concerns over the casualisation and perceived importance of teaching; and, growing expectations around ethics, diversity, and sustainability. That this challenge is unresolved and becoming increasingly difficult suggests a need for innovative practices in both learning and teaching, and how learning and teaching is enabled. Starting in 2019 and accelerated by a Learning Management System (LMS) migration starting in 2021 a small group have been refining and using an alternate set of principles and practices to respond to this challenge by developing reusable orchestrations – organised arrangements of actions, tools, methods, and processes (Dron, 2022) – to sustainably, and at scale, fulfill diverse requirements for quality learning and teaching. Leading to a process where requirements are informed through collegial networks of learning and teaching stakeholders that weigh their objective strategic and contextual concerns to inform priority and approach. Helping to share knowledge and concerns and develop institutional capability laterally and in recognition of available educator expertise.  

The presentation will be structured around three common tasks: quality assurance of course sites; migrating content between two LMS; and, designing effective course sites. For each task a comparison will be made between the group’s innovative orchestrations and standard institutional/vendor orchestrations. These comparisons will: demonstrate the benefits of the innovative orchestrations; outline the development process; and, explain the three principles informing this work - 1) contextual digital augmentation, 2) meso-level automation, and 3) generativity and adaptive reuse. The comparisons will also be used to establish the practical and theoretical inspirations for the approach, including: RPA and citizen development; and, convivial technologies (Illich, 1973), lightweight IT development (Bygstad, 2017), and socio-material understandings of educational technology (Dron, 2022). The breadth of the work will be illustrated through an overview of the growing catalogue of orchestrations using a gatherers, weavers, and augmenters taxonomy.

### Structure

#### Set the scene

- Something about the difficulty of providing quality L&T in the current context

Work in the following Quote from [solutions engineer's job ad](https://jobs.lever.co/instructure/438e3c44-d187-4265-a3d8-91628977186e) from instructure
> We make better, more usable tools for teaching, learning and employee development (you know, stuff people will actually use). A better connected and more open edtech ecosystem

- Something about "more usable tools" being important

![](images/InstructureSalesEngineer.png)  

#### Which of these is more usable?

Show the three tasks (or a subset) and ask get people to vote on which is more usable


#### How we did it?

Talk about the gatherers, weavers, augmenters metaphor giving some idea of the architecture. Talk about leveraging 

##### Principles and implications?

    Talk about the three principles - abstracting from gatherers, weavers, augmenters - and generalise into implications for what we do and what others might do. Link to context
