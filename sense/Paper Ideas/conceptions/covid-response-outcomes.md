# COVID Response outcomes



## From Bellaby et al

Although the impact of COVID-19 and the emergency migration of online courses is irrefutably seismic, we are merely at the beginning of being able to recognise the full impacts of this on higher education. Indeed, much of the literature is embryonic and mostly relies on speculation to form assertions on the changing nature of the educational landscape and a post-pandemic pedagogy. Nevertheless, it seems safe to surmise that “shift to online learning looks set to continue at least until the advent of a successful vaccine for COVID-19” (Burki, 2020, p.  758). Dhawan (2020) has declared that teaching online is no longer a choice but a necessity, going so far as to optimistically proclaim it a “panacea for the crisis” (p. 3). He (Dhawan, 2020) also cautions that the quality of online courses amidst the crisis will determine an institution’s reputation. Watermeyer et el., (2020) similarly speculates that only those institutions that provide a quality online experience will gain market advantage.
