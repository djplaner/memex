# Exploring conceptions of technology: Implications for learning, teaching, and meso-level practitioners

What might different conceptions of technology imply for learning, teaching, and meso-level practitioners

Vague [ASCILITE 2021 idea](https://2021conference.ascilite.org/about-ascilite-2021/submission-and-review-process/)
- Probably full paper - theoretical review
- Possible theme alignment:
    - Back to the Future: Post-COVID Landscape - Immediate response to COVID necessitated rapid uptake of technology but largely still plagued by naive conceptions of technology visible pre-COVID. Better conceptions could help Post-COVID landscape "be better"
  - Leadership, Digital Transformation, Digital Citzenship - focusing on Digital Transformation i.e. to achieve digital transformation you really have to properly conceptualise technology
- Possible new titles
  - Exploring conceptions of technology to digital transform post-COVID practice


## Abstract

- Technology in L&T and the work of meso-level practitioners is core and growing
- But conceptions of technology and digital technology that inform literature, work and organisations is naive and under theorised
- *Research Question* What might different conceptions of technology imply for learning, teaching and meso-level practitioners
- *Research method* Combination of conceptual/theoretical paper might actually be one of the different sessions at ASCILITE

My idea is based around the question: What might different conceptions of technology imply for meso-level practitioners (i.e. us), learning, and teaching?
 
The method would take different conceptions of technology (e.g. Dron, [postdigital](https://link-springer-com.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/article/10.1007/s42438-019-00045-y), [digital objects](https://web-b-ebscohost-com.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&sid=51368ef5-a547-431b-a0e0-2797229d815e%40pdc-v-sessmgr02&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#AN=141906418&db=bth), and perhaps others) and use them as a lens to analyse the work we do and explore if and how that might change.  The idea is that our work (as required by the context we work in) is informed by certain conceptions of technology (e.g. pedagogy before technology). Conceptions, which these other authors, argue are severely limited. Applying these new conceptions to what we do might reveal interesting and useful implications.
 

## Introduction

The web came with all sorts of promise (Berners-Lee)
[From here](https://dighum.ec.tuwien.ac.at/dighum-manifesto/) the great digitisation of society is failing - "monopolisation of the Web, rise of extermist opinions and behaviour" etc. Echoes of this in higher education - with proctoring services, copy detection etc.

Could make the point that we're into the second wave
- First wave followed the dot com boom in the 90s. With online learning exploding and seen as something that would revolutionise higher education
- Second wave - post-COVID - where it became a necessity, not a choice, to go online around the same time when University management ex1Gplicitly killing off the lecture.

As illustrated by the second wave, the first wave never really took off (with some exceptions) ...mention references...By the time the second wave is launching there are issues.
Australian surveys of the COVID experience wasn't great.

### Importance of digital technology

[Aust government launches $1.2bn digital strategy](https://ia.acs.org.au/content/ia/article/2021/govt-adds--1-2b-digital-strategy-to-budget.html?ref=newsletter), including quotes from the PM 
> Every business in Australia is now a digital business,” he said.  “This transformation is not merely a national one that needs to happen – it’s a global one that is happening.  “We must keep our foot on the digital accelerator to secure our economic recovery from COVID-19.”

## Conceptualisations of Technology: Digital and beyond

Initially focus on three conceptions

1. Dron and Arthur - Technology as orchestrating phenomena for a purpose [[educational-technology-what-is-it-and-how-it-works]]
2. Nature of digital technology - NoDT + the IS idea that digital is ubiqutous
3. Post-digital and the material view - beyond digital e.g. [Goodyear's blog post](https://petergoodyear.net/2021/04/23/where-is-no-longer-a-simple-question/)

Give a summary of these.

## Situations facing Meso-level practitioners

### Pedagogy has nothing to teach us

The _Times Higher Ed_ piece that has a lecturer bemoaning "holier than thou educationalists" mandating how they teach under the "feared" umbrella term _pedagogy_.  Hints at PCK and TPACK as a response indicating the importance of thinking of the assembly. Of not talking just about pedagogy, but about how that will be assembled within a specific sport. Reducing the effort of the lecturer in having to orchestrate and assemble.

**Orchestrate and assemble, versus orchestrate** is there value in conceptualising too much of what has to be done in teaching as assembly, rather than orchestration?  To make a particular technology - be it pedagogy or digital technology - it is necessary to assemble it into a form that is appropriate for the specific purpose. Assembly is about refining and connecting all the different technology to fit the specific purpose that the lecturer (and eventually the student) has.  Orchestration is simply using it.

The aim is you want to enable more assembly, but not require it, and support orchestration.  Too much of our technology requires significant work to do both assembly and orchestration.

### Misc. stuff from literature, twitter etc.

- [Reports from MLPs](https://twitter.com/BrianCHolt/status/1387064997470117891) about how most faculty development is "how to use a tool like Canvas"
  These development sessions show how to assemble technologies into usable assemblies. They are too low level to provide specific assemblies. Hence require a lot of work and knowledge, too much for people who don't see the need.
- We never teach how to teach 
  Because teaching is actually assembly of activity systems. Hence when you teach you have to teach at the level of phenomena (essentially, but not always, the same as "how to use Canvas") 

### Tyranny of integrated systems and limited form of integration

### Link between productivity paradox and how digital technology is treated

[Why productivity growth has stalled since 2005](https://theconversation.com/why-productivity-growth-has-stalled-since-2005-and-isnt-about-to-improve-soon-159706)

Has a comment about moving toward "generalisation" which might be because traditional IT is unable to deal with assemblies that aren't general

### Increasing calls for Modularity

e.g Sways being stand alone, not manipuable. Versus what might be done in BJourn OUA project

At the wrong level of assembly?? Or is it a case that Sway aims to try to make assembly into something pretty fairly easy and interactive. But by becoming a more closed/hard technology.  At one level it makes reuse in other contexts very easy, but as brick that can't be changed. Hitting the reusability level.

The Content Interface by focusing on semantic Word documents/HTML with a University specific semantic layer allows for manipulation and repurposing. e.g. as simple as changing university dates.
