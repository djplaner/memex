# Exploring conceptions of technology: Implications for learning, teaching, and meso-level practitioners

What might different conceptions of technology imply for learning, teaching, and meso-level practitioners

Vague ASCILITE 2021 idea

- Technology in L&T and the work of meso-level practitioners is core and growing
- But conceptions of technology and digital technology that inform literature, work and organisations is naive and under theorised
- *Research Question* What might different conceptions of technology imply for learning, teaching and meso-level practitioners
- *Research method* Combination of conceptual/theoretical paper might actually be one of the different sessions at ASCILITE

My idea is based around the question: What might different conceptions of technology imply for meso-level practitioners (i.e. us), learning, and teaching?
 
The method would take different conceptions of technology (e.g. Dron, [postdigital](https://link-springer-com.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/article/10.1007/s42438-019-00045-y), [digital objects](https://web-b-ebscohost-com.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&sid=51368ef5-a547-431b-a0e0-2797229d815e%40pdc-v-sessmgr02&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#AN=141906418&db=bth), and perhaps others) and use them as a lens to analyse the work we do and explore if and how that might change.  The idea is that our work (as required by the context we work in) is informed by certain conceptions of technology (e.g. pedagogy before technology). Conceptions, which these other authors, argue are severely limited. Applying these new conceptions to what we do might reveal interesting and useful implications.
 
This could be a full paper with a traditional 20/25 minute presentation. Or,  In 2019 ASCILITE did trial more interactive (and longer) sessions which didn't have a full paper. But focused more on active participation with the audience. e.g. a sequence of activities where others apply these newly introduced conceptions and derive their own implications

## Introduction

The web came with all sorts of promise (Berners-Lee)
[From here](https://dighum.ec.tuwien.ac.at/dighum-manifesto/) the great digitisation of society is failing - "monopolisation of the Web, rise of extermist opinions and behaviour" etc. Echoes of this in higher education - with proctoring services, copy detection etc.

Could make the point that we're into the second wave
- First wave followed the dot com boom in the 90s. With online learning exploding and seen as something that would revolutionise higher education
- Second wave - post-COVID - where it became a necessity, not a choice, to go online around the same time when University management explicitly killing off the lecture.

As illustrated by the second wave, the first wave never really took off (with some exceptions) ...mention references...By the time the second wave is launching there are issues.
