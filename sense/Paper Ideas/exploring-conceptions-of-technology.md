# Exploring conceptions of technology: Implications for learning, teaching, and meso-level practitioners

What might different conceptions of technology imply for learning, teaching, and meso-level practitioners

Vague [ASCILITE 2021 idea](https://2021conference.ascilite.org/about-ascilite-2021/submission-and-review-process/)
- Probably full paper - theoretical review
- Possible theme alignment:
    - Back to the Future: Post-COVID Landscape - Immediate response to COVID necessitated rapid uptake of technology but largely still plagued by naive conceptions of technology visible pre-COVID. Better conceptions could help Post-COVID landscape "be better"
  - Leadership, Digital Transformation, Digital Citzenship - focusing on Digital Transformation i.e. to achieve digital transformation you really have to properly conceptualise technology
- Possible new titles
  - Exploring conceptions of technology to digital transform post-COVID practice


## Abstract

- Technology in L&T and the work of meso-level practitioners is core and growing
- But conceptions of technology and digital technology that inform literature, work and organisations is naive and under theorised
- *Research Question* What might different conceptions of technology imply for learning, teaching and meso-level practitioners
- *Research method* Combination of conceptual/theoretical paper might actually be one of the different sessions at ASCILITE

My idea is based around the question: What might different conceptions of technology imply for meso-level practitioners (i.e. us), learning, and teaching?
 
The method would take different conceptions of technology (e.g. Dron, [postdigital](https://link-springer-com.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/article/10.1007/s42438-019-00045-y), [digital objects](https://web-b-ebscohost-com.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&sid=51368ef5-a547-431b-a0e0-2797229d815e%40pdc-v-sessmgr02&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#AN=141906418&db=bth), and perhaps others) and use them as a lens to analyse the work we do and explore if and how that might change.  The idea is that our work (as required by the context we work in) is informed by certain conceptions of technology (e.g. pedagogy before technology). Conceptions, which these other authors, argue are severely limited. Applying these new conceptions to what we do might reveal interesting and useful implications.
 

## Introduction

The web came with all sorts of promise (Berners-Lee)
[From here](https://dighum.ec.tuwien.ac.at/dighum-manifesto/) the great digitisation of society is failing - "monopolisation of the Web, rise of extermist opinions and behaviour" etc. Echoes of this in higher education - with proctoring services, copy detection etc.

Could make the point that we're into the second wave
- First wave followed the dot com boom in the 90s. With online learning exploding and seen as something that would revolutionise higher education
- Second wave - post-COVID - where it became a necessity, not a choice, to go online around the same time when University management ex1Gplicitly killing off the lecture.

As illustrated by the second wave, the first wave never really took off (with some exceptions) ...mention references...By the time the second wave is launching there are issues.

## Conceptualisations of Technology: Digital and beyond

Initially focus on three conceptions

1. Dron and Arthur - Technology as orchestrating phenomena for a purpose
2. Nature of digital technology - NoDT + the IS idea that digital is ubiqutous
3. Post-digital and the material view - beyond digital e.g. [Goodyear's blog post](https://petergoodyear.net/2021/04/23/where-is-no-longer-a-simple-question/)

Give a summary of these.

## Situations facing Meso-level practitioners

### Tyranny of integrated systems and limited form of integration
### Increasing calls for Modularity

e.g Sways being stand alone, not manipuable. Versus what might be done in BJourn OUA project

At the wrong level of assembly?? Or is it a case that Sway aims to try to make assembly into something pretty fairly easy and interactive. But by becoming a more closed/hard technology.  At one level it makes reuse in other contexts very easy, but as brick that can't be changed. Hitting the reusability level.

The Content Interface by focusing on semantic Word documents/HTML with a University specific semantic layer allows for manipulation and repurposing. e.g. as simple as changing university dates.
