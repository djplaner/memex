# Dealing with bad relationships by turning BAD: An LMS migration case study

A case study of an LMS migration
- TeLdesigner work is fruitfully dealing with relationships - post-digital, ANT
- Too often the work they are set and how they are expected to work is atomistic, not relational
- Perhaps one explanation why the relationships suffer, they are bad relationships
- If we're to do any better this relationships have to be better, more productive...
- This paper will use a case study of an LMS migration to
    - give examples of these bad relationships
    - give examples of how these can be improved
    - use the SET/BAD mindsets to explain 
	- ???

- BAD/SET as theoretical framework
- BAD to encapsulate broader/deeper theoretical viewpoints
- But with a tendency toward action - how to do things as MLPs
