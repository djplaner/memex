# Meddler in the middle

See also: [[design]], [[Meddler in the middle]]

McWilliam's ([2009](https://eprints.qut.edu.au/32389/1/c32389.pdf)) addition of "meddler in the middle" to the "sage on the stage" and "guide one the side" got a [mention somewhere at the conference](https://twitter.com/leanner000/status/1599571032708636672). Apparently related [to this blog post](https://warburton.typepad.com/liquidlearning/2022/03/claiming-the-middle-ground-the-agile-and-adaptive-educator.html) which appeared in Campus Morning Mail. A post that describes McWilliam's distinction between the three roles and includes a call for folk likely to be in the ASCILITE crowd to avoid being either sages or guides and become more likely meddlers.

## Three orders of learning

Markauskaite & Goodyear (2017) have similar idea with the three orders of learning. Where the 3rd order is _teaching as co-configuration_
