## Reflections

### Where's the digital?

[ASCILITE's aspiration](https://ascilite.org/about-ascilite/) is to be
> recognised internationally as Australasia's foremost community for the use of digital technologies in tertiary education. 

But the consideration of "digital technologies" appears to be limited at times. 

For example, the first keynote drew on Glazier's (2021) suggestions for building human connections online:

1. Humanize the instructor 
2. Provide personalized feedback 
3. Reach out to students 
4. Support student peer collaboration

Pretty good, but those suggestions seem to apply regardless of whether you're using digital or online technologies to build human connections.

Another example on the first day were the _6 principles for digital learning innovation_ ([Adachi et al 2022](https://publications.ascilite.org/index.php/APUB/article/view/140)):

1. Create a safe place for new ideas
2. Keep focused on your purposes.
3. Keep focused on your users.
4. Be ethical.
5. Start small and build up.
6. Think holistically

These seem likely to be as useful as principles of innovation for QANTAS or McDonalds. Nothing here to provide specific advice on either digital innovation, learning innovation, or digital learning innovation.

This observation isn't intended to limit the value of these principles as useful guides for the practice of digital education or education more broadly. Instead, I'm wondering if at ASCILITE - given ASCILITE's aspirations - there should be more explicit engagement with digital technologies? Perhaps questions like if/how/why etc. the use of digital technologies in tertiary education complicates, aids, hinders etc the building of human connections or innovation (and many more).

Without at least some focus on these types of questions, I wonder how ASCILITE differentiates itself from [HERDSA](https://www.herdsa.org.au/about-herdsa) and its commitment to "the advancement of higher and tertiary education"?




### The missing last mile? Orchestration? Meddler in the middle?

_Work in progress_

McWilliam's ([2009](https://eprints.qut.edu.au/32389/1/c32389.pdf)) addition of "meddler in the middle" to the "sage on the stage" and "guide one the side" got a [mention somewhere at the conference](https://twitter.com/leanner000/status/1599571032708636672). Apparently related [to this blog post](https://warburton.typepad.com/liquidlearning/2022/03/claiming-the-middle-ground-the-agile-and-adaptive-educator.html) which appeared in Campus Morning Mail. A post that describes McWilliam's distinction between the three roles and includes a call for folk likely to be in the ASCILITE crowd to avoid being either sages or guides and become more likely meddlers.

I'm wondering how what is being presented at ASCILITE fits into these three roles? In turn, this begs the question about where our institutional L&T practices might fit?

It is important to restate McWilliam's point (2009, p. 287-288) that
> Both Sage-on-the-Stage and Guide-on-the-Side have their place in the complex landscape that is teaching....In other words, the meta-categories “Sage” and “Guide” can themselves be representative of a complexity of pedagogical moves, not a simple formula.

Glazier's (2021) principles for building human connection online strike me as guide on the side. As does Deakin's [tools guide](https://tl-tools-guide.deakin.edu.au/) ([Colasante et al, 2022](https://publications.ascilite.org/index.php/APUB/article/view/118)). Useful guides for navigating complex decisions about how to create good L&T experiences/environments. Potentially developing such guide's become an "excuse...to 'step out' of the main game" (McWilliam, 2009, p. 287). i.e. rather than engage actively in the process of developing those learning experiences, central L&T focuses attention on the guides. 

Obviously the people at ASCILITE and the roles they represent in institutional L&T are not seeking to "step out" of that process. Some are very much involved in it. Instead, my question is if/how/what/where are the ASCILITE papers that talk about that active engagement in the main game?

McWilliams' (2009) description is
> of a third meta-category geared up for creative capacity building – that of Meddler-in-the-Middle. This meta-category is descriptive of active interventionist pedagogy in which teachers are mutually involved with students in assembling and/or dis-assembling knowledge and cultural products.

What does an ASCILITE paper that talks (and the institutional practices/experience it reports on) about the experience of being mutually involved in the assembling and/or dis-assembling of L&T experiences look like? What am I missing?

That's what I need to be looking for now.

Does the nature of meddling make it hard to write papers? To get recognition?
