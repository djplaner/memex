## Work take aways

### Relationships, connections etc.

Lots of different insights and perspectives on building relationships


### It's not the tool, it's how you use is - OnTask, generic resources and templates

Both the first two papers are from UTS and CIC work.

[Kitto](./ascilite2022-day-one#how-can-edtech-support-graduate-employability) uses the need to embed a general skills analytics tool (seem employability below for more) into courses and subjects. It identifies both the learning design, technical, and broader challenges involved in doing this
- "without adding undue stress to teaching teams and students?"
- "simply pointing students to an EdTech based tool that they 'may want to explore' rarely results in significant uptake of the service"
- "How can we embed such tools into a course’s design without disrupting the course structure itself?"
- "However, as Shibani et al. (2019) argue, in attempting to build tools that are scalable it is all too common to adopt a one size fits all mentality, which fails to contextualise their use to the different problems that students are likely to be facing throughout this whole of course journey"
- "We note that the current functionality of Canvas Commons does not really support the type of structure we would like to enable for sharing these resources"

### Employability

[Kitto](./ascilite2022-day-one#how-can-edtech-support-graduate-employability) talks about the task of embedding the [TRACK Skills Analytics tool](https://cic.uts.edu.au/tools/track-skills-analytics/) (lot of info on this page). TRACK explorer focuses on the student taking action to map their skills and use that to identify and plan career options. TRACK designer helps course/program designers map program structures to related job/career skills. It is based on a database of 17,000 skills related to job advertisements. You [can try it here](https://open.uts.edu.au/track-explorer/) (requires registration).

## Reflections

- [Where's the digital?](reflections/wheres-the-digital.md) 
- [[Meddler in the middle]]

## To do

- [ ] Follow up with Tim re: Canvas, collaboration and his story board

    - Talk about framing this

- [ ] Follow up on Kitto's references and linkages also the portal paper and its focus on scalability

- [ ] What is the theory of our work (e.g. as argued by "Where is the “theory” within the field of educational technology research?")
