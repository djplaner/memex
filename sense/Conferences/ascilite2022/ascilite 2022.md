## Reflections

### Where's the digital? Where's the learning?

A drive for the ASCILITE crowd is something like help teachers and those designing teaching figure out how to creatively and sustainably provide effective L&T experiences/environments.

Examples include Glazier's (2021) suggestions for building human connections online, which the keynote presented as the following

1. Humanize the instructor 
2. Provide personalized feedback 
3. Reach out to students 
4. Support student peer collaboration

There was the _6 principles for digital learning innovation_ ([Adachi et al 2022](https://publications.ascilite.org/index.php/APUB/article/view/140)) which were

1. Create a safe place for new ideas
2. Keep focused on your purposes.
3. Keep focused on your users.
4. Be ethical.
5. Start small and build up.
6. Think holistically

What strikes me about both these is that they say nothing about "digital". They apply more broadly. Glazier's to L&T in any context. The digital learning principles are more generic again. Nothing specific in those about digital or learning. Could equally apply to QANTAS as a university.

Where is the digital? What is the role of digital?
