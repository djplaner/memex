# The relationships between BAD/SET, CASA, and Gather/Weave

Over the last 10+ years colleagues and I have been reflecting on experiences trying to stretch the [[iron-triangle]]. That work has resulted in three different abstractions/mini-theories:

1. The [[bad]]/set (Bricolage, Affordances, Distribution / Strategic, Established, Tree-like) framework (Jones & Clark, 2014) and [related blog posts](https://djon.es/blog/category/bad/)
2. [[casa]] - Context Appropriate Scaffolding Assessmblages (Jones, Lawson, Beer, & Jones, 2018; Jones, 2019) and [related blog posts](https://djon.es/blog/category/casa/)
3. The idea of [[gather-weave-augment]] ([Jones, 2022](https://djon.es/blog/2022/10/10/orchestrating-entangled-relations-to-stretch-the-iron-triangle-observations-from-an-lms-migration/#poster); [Booten, Cook, & Jones, 2023](https://djon.es/blog/2023/02/09/gathers-weavers-and-augmenters-three-principles-for-dynamic-and-sustainable-delivery-of-quality-learning-and-teaching/))

This page is an attempt to explore the relationships between these three mini-theories.  It's a work in progress.

## An initial explanation 

This all takes place within the challenge of helping higher education institutions (HEI) grow access to higher education while maximising both quality and cost efficiency (i.e. stretch the [[iron-triangle]]). The assumption is that [[design-for-learning]] is the way to achieve this. Ellis & Goodyear (2019) identify design for learning is key for quality and student satisfaction. Goodyear (2015) argues that seeing teaching as design for learning is an effective way to stretch the iron triangle. Flowing from that is the idea that HEI's should be focused on supporting teaching as design. 

How does a HEI support teaching as design to stretch the iron triangle?

### BAD/SET - The current situation

The [[bad]]/SET mindsets provide a description of two (arguably) incommensurable approaches to doing this. The SET mindset describes how institutions try to stretch the iron triangle. The BAD mindset describes how individual teachers/teaching teams try to stretch the iron triangle. We argued that there needed to be a way to interweave both these approaches and that current failure to do so is creating a chasm between the rhetoric and reality of L&T in higher ed (Jones & Clark, 2014)

### CASA - One way to bridge the gap (interweave BAD/SET)

As the name suggests - contextually-appropriate scaffolding assemblages - CASA are collections of practices, processes, technologies etc designed to help support a specific L&T activity. Collections that follow the [CASA design principles](https://djon.es/blog/2019/08/08/exploring-knowledge-reuse-in-design-for-digital-learning-tweaks-h5p-constructive-templates-and-casa/#initial-design-principles-adr-stage-4) are thought to be more effective at interweaving the SET and BAD approaches.

### How to automate/augment gathering and weaving 

The [[gather-weave-augment]] idea is based on the observation that [[design-for-learning]] needs to draw on expert knowledge from numerous fields, including contextual knowledge. That the core of supporting and doing [[design-for-learning]] is sustainably and effectively gathering and weaving disparate strands of knowledge and technology. As suggested in the [[entangled-pedagogy]] view the ability to orchestrate these disparate strands is key.

Our recent work (Jones, 2022; Cook et al, 2023) was driven by the limitations and inefficiencies of current practices for gathering and weaving. Leading us to develop a nascent set of principles for automating and augmenting the gathering and weaving task. In practice, our use of these principles has been to eventually develop CASA for widely different purposes.
