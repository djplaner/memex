# The relationships between BAD/SET, CASA, and Gather/Weave

Over the last 10+ years colleagues and I have been reflecting on experiences trying to stretch the [[iron-triangle]]. That work has resulted in three different abstractions/mini-theories:

1. The [[bad]]/set (Bricolage, Affordances, Distribution / Strategic, Established, Tree-like) framework (Jones & Clark, 2014) and [related blog posts](https://djon.es/blog/category/bad/)
2. [[CASA]] - Context Appropriate Scaffolding Assessmblages (Jones, Lawson, Beer, & Jones, 2018; Jones, 2019) and [related blog posts](https://djon.es/blog/category/casa/)
3. The idea of [[gather-weave-augment]] ([Jones, 2022](https://djon.es/blog/2022/10/10/orchestrating-entangled-relations-to-stretch-the-iron-triangle-observations-from-an-lms-migration/#poster); [Booten, Cook, & Jones, 2023](https://djon.es/blog/2023/02/09/gathers-weavers-and-augmenters-three-principles-for-dynamic-and-sustainable-delivery-of-quality-learning-and-teaching/))
