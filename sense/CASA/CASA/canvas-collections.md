## Introduction 

Canvas Collections can be used to transform the Canvas modules index page by adding structure, visuals, and context. Below is an introduction to Canvas Collections. See the [Canvas Collections' site for much more](https://djplaner.github.io/canvas-collections/getting-started/how-to-start/).

The images below are of the same course. The left hand image is the vanilla Canvas modules page. The right hand image is the same modules page with Canvas Collections configured.
