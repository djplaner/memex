# Heavy Weight and Light Weight Information Technology

Idea generated from Bygstad (2017, p. 180)
> Lightweight IT is suggested as a term for the new knowledge regime of mobile apps, sensors and bring-your-own-device, also called consumerisation and Internet-of-Things. The key aspect of **lightweight IT is not only the cheaper** and more available technology compared with heavyweight IT, but the fact that its deployment is frequently done by users or vendors, bypassing the IT departments

They define lightweight IT as: (p. 181)
> a socio-technical knowledge regime, driven by competent users’ need for solutions, enabled by the consumerisation of digital technology, and realied through innovation processes

Godfroi et al (2021) do a systematic literature review on related topics

## A comparison of lightweight and heavyweight IT

Uses 4 case studies from health sector to find
1. "generativity enfolds differently in heavyweight and lightweight IT"
2. "generativity in digital infrastructures is supported by the interaction of loosely coupled heavyweight and lightweight IT" Bygstad (2017, p.180)
> The practical design implication is that heavyweight and lightweight IT shoould be loosely integrated, both in terms of technology, standardisation and organisation.

These are _ideal types_.  

Argues that trends in consumer and enterprise IT can be fruitfully thought of as paradigmatic shift to two different knowledge regimes: _heavyweight_ and _lightweight_ IT

| Characteristics | Heavyweight IT | Lightweight IT |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
|           | A knowledge regime, driven by IT profesionals, enabled by systematic specification and proven digital technology and realised through software engineering | A knowledge regime, driven by competent users' need for solutions, enabled by the consumerisation of digital technology and relaised through innovation processes |
| Profile | Back-end: supporting documentation of work | Front-end: supporting work processes |
| Owner | IT Department | Users and vendors |
| Systems | Transation systems | Process support, apps, BI |
| Technology | PCs, servers, databases, integration technology | Tablets, electronic whiteboards, mobile phones | 
| IT architecture | Fully integrated solutions, centralised or distributed architecture | Non-invasive solutions, frequently meshworks (heterogeneous networks) |
| Development culture | Systematics, quality, security | Innovation, experimentation |
| Problems | Increasing complexity, rising costs | Isolated gadgets, security |
| Discourse | Software engineering | Business and practice innovation|
