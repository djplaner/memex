# Concrete Lounges

Originally expressed [in a blog post](https://djon.es/blog/2014/12/18/concrete-lounge/).

The Concrete Lounge is a nascent analogy intended to help explain the need for more people to take on the role of [[digital-renovator]]. Especially in the context of university-based educational technology.

The argument being that universities need to focus more on enabling digital renovators than just trying to create perfect systems (that end up as concrete lounges)
