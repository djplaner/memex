# Ponderings on AI 

The rise of chatGPT has seen various ponderings, here's mine.

The interesting questions I have include

- What is the nature of the technology? 

    Some attempt to understand the objective features, capabilities etc of the technology.
- What are its affordances?

    Affordances is a useful concept because it is relational. Affordances arise from the relationship between the technology, user, their context, and purpose (task).  
- What can we do with those nature/affordances?
