# 2 Sigma Problem

Experiments using three types of learning methods
<ol> <li> conventional classroom learning; </li>
  <li> mastery learning;<p>Apparently 1st defined by Bloom. Class sizes of 20 to 30 students, which as a group must get at least 90% on a knowledge test before the class moved on.  Formative tests are given to inform corrective procedures and others to test understanding</p> </li>
  <li> 1-to-1 tutoring;<p>Individual teaching using formative tests and feedback similar to the mastery learning tests.</p> </li>
</ol>

Results 
<ol>
  <li> Two-sigma - 1-to-1 <p>Average student with 1-to-1 tutoring with mastery performed higher than 98% of students using classroom approach - two standard deviations higher.</p> </li>
  <li> 1-sigma - mastery<p>average student in this method achieved 84% above conventional classroom</p> </li>
  <li> "90% of tutored students and 70% of the mastery learning students attained the level of summative achievement reached by only the highest 20% of the students under conventional instructional conditions" (Bloom, 1984, p. 4) </li>
</ol>

Questions 
<ol>
  <li> How do the "smart" or the less motivated students deal with mastery learning's requirement to keep going over a topic until all achieve 90%? </li>
  <li> How would a teacher handle this in a traditional setting? </li>
</ol>

Methods
<ol>
  <li> "solving" mentions Khan Academy
        <p>Reliant on student motivation to engage, could be supported.</p> 
       </li>
  <li> "solving" mentions Udemy having "massive office hours"
       <p>Lots of tutors available to handle questions. Leading to ideas of call-centres to ensure tutors are available when required. Raising the "AIC" problem where the tutor may not get the content/teaching approach being used in the course.</p> </li>
  <li> "solving" talks about various forms of "feedback-corrective" tools - leading toward the personalisation approach and to differentiated instruction and adaptive learning systems (which is what Khan has become somewhat) </li>
  <li> "solving" does touch on the idea of Fitbit/IoT type devices providing specific feedback. </li>
  <li> "back" talks about CBE and analytics as providing data that can provide teachers with the insight required to support mastery approaches. </li>
</ol>

Bloom's (1984) suggestions
<ol>
  <li> improving instructional materials </li>
  <li> enhancing peer interactions </li>
  <li> considering student differences  </li>
  <li> engaging higher mental processes </li>
</ol>

Implementation requirements
<ol>
  <li> Identify all that is required to be learned and the order in which it is to be learned. 
        <p>Not always possible or desirable in all courses, touches on arguments against learning objectives etc. </p>
        <p>Comment on "back" makes this point and suggests "look to the future and use dynamic learning more aligned with today’s technologies and the capacity to measure learning post hoc". </p>
  </li>
  <li> Develop appropriate instructional methods and formative/summative tests to identify mastery. </li>
  <li> Develop/implement corrective measures based on results from tests. 
      <p>In a class setting or by single tutor.</p></li>
</ol>

Problems with 2-sigma
<ol>
  <li> VanLehn (2011) in a review article found that human tutoring had an effect size of 0.79 (rather than 2), while intelligent tutoring systems had an effect size of 0.76 </li>
  <li> "the problem" quotes VanLehn (2011) deeper explorations of the experiments Bloom reported upon, 
        <ul> 
           <li> Topic was probabilty </li>
           <li> tutors were education majors (not necessarily experts in probability) </li>
           <li> Only one of the 6 studies of human tutoring from Bloom involved 1-to-1 (others had tutors working with 3 students) </li>
           <li> the "mastery mark" for the class-based mastery was 80%, but for tutoring 90%.  That tutors were holding students to a higher standard may explain 2.0 effect size achieved while class-based mastery only achieved 1.0 </li> 
        </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
