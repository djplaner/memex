# Overcoming one size fits all learning

<a href="http://info.alleninteractions.com/overcoming-one-size-fits-all-learning">Blog post</a> touching on the problem of one-size-fits-all, de-contextualised learning approaches and offering a method for addressing the <a href="http://wikity.djon.es/2-sigma-problem/">2 sigma problem</a> that relies on the learner.  

Illustrate this with an example from software training.

Not sure how this could be implemented.

<h3>Other connections</h3>

I do wonder how this approach would work/connect with the <a href="http://wikity.djon.es/digital-technologies-and-impact-of-badabsent-schema/">schema/model problem</a>
