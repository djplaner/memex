# TPP7165 Digital Literacy

 

> The course provides an introduction to digital literacy, but caters for students with a diverse range of skills and knowledge, in that learning tasks are primarily open in nature. The main aim of the course is to equip students with the requisite skills, knowledge and confidence to interact successfully with the USQ online environment. An additional aim is to equip students with the skills and confidence needed to enhance their digital literacy as it might apply in later work environments. Accordingly, requisite skills and knowledge are developed as students investigate digital literacy in relation to their own vocational interests. The curriculum design in the course is based on intrinsic motivational theory, in that students are encouraged to consider digital literacy in a vocation that is of personal relevance.
