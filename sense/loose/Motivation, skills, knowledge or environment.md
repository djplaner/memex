# Motivation, skills, knowledge or environment


<a href="http://blog.cathy-moore.com/2013/05/is-training-really-the-answer-ask-the-flowchart/">Training may not be the answer</a>. Lack of knowledge is not the only reason why people may not be able to perform a particular activity.  The problem might arise from anyone of 
<ul>
  <li> Motivation </li>
  <li> Skills </li>
  <li> Knowledge </li>
  <li> Environment </li>
</ul>

On a related notion, <a href="http://www.nwlink.com/~donclark/coaching/coach.html">this</a> on coaching argues that the four major causes of performance problems are
<ol>
  <li> Knowledge or skills <?li>
  <li> Process </li>
  <li> Resources </li>
  <li> Motivation or culture </li>
</ol>

That's perhaps a slightly better formulation.  Offers a "Performance Analysis Quadrant" to aid analysis. Has some references and more detail.
