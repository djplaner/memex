# Motivation, skills, knowledge or environment

[Training may not be the answer.](http://blog.cathy-moore.com/2013/05/is-training-really-the-answer-ask-the-flowchart/) Lack of knowledge is not the only reason why people may not be able to perform a particular activity.  The problem might arise from anyone of

- Motivation
- Skills
- Knowledge
- Environment

On a related notion, [this](http://www.nwlink.com/~donclark/coaching/coach.html) on coaching argues that the four major causes of performance problems are

1. Knowledge or skills
2. Process
3. Resources
4. Motivation or culture

That's perhaps a slightly better formulation.  Offers a "Performance Analysis Quadrant" to aid analysis. Has some references and more detail.
