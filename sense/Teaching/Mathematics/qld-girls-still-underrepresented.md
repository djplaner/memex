# Queensland girls still underrepresented in specialist maths despite push to increase participation - ABC News

Girls are missing out on high-paying graduate jobs requiring specialist maths because fewer are choosing the subject in high school, a peak industry body says.

*   The Australian Mathematical Sciences Institute expects a recent decline in specialist mathematics enrolments to continue
*   Recent data shows less than a third of students enrolled in physics and engineering are girls
*   Only about a quarter of the STEM workforce are women, according to the 2022 STEM Equity Monitor

New data shows girls account for about one-third of physics and specialist mathematics enrolments in Queensland schools despite years of effort to lift participation.

Australian Mathematical Sciences Institute director Tim Marchant said a recent "dramatic decline" nationally of boys and girls in specialist maths in 2020 — to 9.2 per cent – is expected to be extended in figures still being compiled for 2021.

"Things are getting worse, not better," he said.

Mr Marchant said the overall shortage of mathematical science graduates meant roles in the "booming" industry were starting at six figures.

"Those shortages mean higher salaries for a graduate, so the starting salaries for maths graduates now range between $100,000 to $200,000 in their first year, which is really, really high," he said.

Of Queensland Year 12 students, girls represented between 29 and 31 per cent of physics enrolments, and 36 to 37 per cent of specialist maths students between 2021 and 2023, data from the Queensland Curriculum and Assessment Authority shows.

Females accounted for 14 per cent of Year 12 engineering enrolments this year, increasing from 10 per cent in 2021.

Compared with higher-level mathematics, girls' participation in general mathematics and mathematical methods is better, with enrolments at 55 per cent and 47 per cent respectively in 2023.

And, more female students than boys have studied biology and chemistry in the past three years, reaching 66 per cent and 52 per cent respectively this year.

A Queensland education department spokesperson said Queensland Year 12 enrolments in science and mathematics subjects were either consistent or had increased by up to 2.8 percentage points from 2015 to 2019.

"The department will continue working with state schools to emphasise the importance of STEM education and increase engagement in these vital subject areas now and into the future," a department spokesperson said.

The national issue is reflected in the tertiary sector and jobs market with women representing 36 per cent of university STEM enrolments and 27 per cent of the workforce — a one percentage point drop from 2020, according to the 2022 STEM Equity Monitor.

Australia's Chief Scientist Cathy Foley, a physicist, said throughout her career she has too often been the first or the only woman in the room.

"We're seeing lots of women in the life sciences … but what we're not seeing is those women actually being promoted and having secure long-term careers," Dr Foley said.

"In the physical sciences … we're just not attracting young women to see this as a pathway for them.

"There's a skills shortage, particularly with STEM-trained, skilled people, and so if we were able to get equal numbers of women into those roles, that would really be a first step in addressing those shortages."

Why are female enrolments lower?
--------------------------------

Mr Marchant said one of the reasons female participation is lower was believed to be due to maths anxiety and lower confidence.

"There is some survey data which shows that by Year 8, 57 per cent of girls dislike mathematics compared to about 44 per cent of boys, and only 10 per cent of girls really like mathematics compared to 17 per cent of boys.

"So that two-to-one ratio is almost in place by year eight. 

"The interventions we need to put in place are probably about increasing girls' confidence in primary school about mathematics."

Dr Foley said some of the contributing reasons included a national shortage of specialist maths and sciences teachers, as well as a lack of understanding among young people about the future job market.

"If you think about where we're seeing data and technologies, artificial intelligence, machine learning, becoming part of the everyday people having those sorts of skills are urgently needed, and we are not necessarily … giving \[kids\] the chance to recognise this at school."

Mr Marchant called for national programmes to encourage participation to be funded over longer periods beyond election terms.

Brisbane school finding success

Cavendish Road State High School is having success in building a female pipeline of STEM talent, head of science Monique Robin said.

Ms Robin said in junior years the number of males and females doing science is equal, but in senior science there are far more girls in all science subjects.

"The results as well, girls are topping the physics, the chemistry, the biology and the psychology, which is fantastic to see."

Science teacher Steve Griffiths said the school focuses on activities that are fun but are tied to learning to engage students early.

Year 9 student Elyse Griffiths said the reason she loves science was because she likes problem-solving, while Year 7 student Eloise Hammond said "she fell head over heels" for STEM while studying chromatography.

Year 12 student Sofia Thompson completed Year 12 specialist maths a year early because she loved the challenge of an accelerated program.

"Math – I love that it's a language of its own and I love how complex it is, but how applicable it can be," she said.

The federal government last year commissioned a review of diversity in STEM in a bid to improve pathways for girls and women into the field, which is due to report back later this year.

It's part of a push to achieve a target of 1.2 million tech-related jobs by 2030.
