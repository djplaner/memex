See also: [[assessment]]

Place to think out loud and develop ideas.

## Resources to examine

- [Supporting students to use AI responsibly and productively](https://educational-innovation.sydney.edu.au/teaching@sydney/supporting-students-to-use-ai-responsibly-and-productively/)
- [What do do about assessments if we can't out-design or out-run AI?](https://educational-innovation.sydney.edu.au/teaching@sydney/what-to-do-about-assessments-if-we-cant-out-design-or-out-run-ai/)
- [How do we assess in the age of writing co-pilots?](https://educational-innovation.sydney.edu.au/teaching@sydney/chatgpt-is-old-news-how-do-we-assess-in-the-age-of-ai-writing-co-pilots/)

## General good advice

- Do students understand why/how this assessment task fits more broadly with their learning, careers etc.

## LLM specific

Michael Sankey [presentation](https://www.slideshare.net/michaelsankey/principles-of-assessment-259432099), includes some suggestions

- Teaching students how to use generative LLMs
- Enabling students to become creators with LLMs
  - provide feedback on their writing
  - simplify complex information
  - scaffold information on specific task
  - helpful for diverse students (neurodivergent/NESB)
  - In essence, create their own learning resources
- Work around LLMs
  - Balance essays with other kinds of assessments 
  - Design assignments where students demonstrate understanding independent of written works
  - "authentic assessments"
  - personalised or complex tasks
