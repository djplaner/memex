# Worked examples

See also: [[teaching]], [[teaching-mathematics]]

Arising out of [[cognitive-load-theory]] demonstrates the steps required to complete a task. Benefit arises from the explanations of each step taken and then learners using self-explanations to describe the steps.

Effectiveness reduces as the learner gains increased expertise. An approach perhaps best applied to algorithmic skill domains where there a single correct solutions.
