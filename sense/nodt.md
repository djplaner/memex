# Nature of Digital Technology

Line of thought driven by the idea that digital technology is actually different in its [[Affordances]]. That if these differences aren't understood then there are limits on how they can be leveraged for effective and appropriate purposes. Though obviously the nature of digital technology is not the only consideration.

Expanded in some blog posts (e.g. (What is the nature of digital technology)[https://djon.es/blog/2016/06/27/what-is-the-nature-of-digital-technology-part-1/]) and into a presentation titled (Digital technology ignorance and its implications for learning and teaching)[https://djon.es/blog/2016/05/30/digital-technology-ignorance-and-its-implications-for-learning-and-teaching/]
