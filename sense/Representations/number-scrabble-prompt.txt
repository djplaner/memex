As a web developer write a 2-player version of Herb Simon's number scrabble game using HTML, Javascript and CSS.  Provide the HTML, Javascript, and CSS to implement the game. 

The game should take place on a single web page with three main sections: 1) available cards, 2) player 1's selected cards and score, and 3) player 2's selected cards and score. The available cards section should be displayed centered on the top of the page. The two players' sections are displayed underneath the available cards section and displayed next to each other.

At the start of the game, the available cards section will display a horizontal sequence of 9 cards numbers 1 to 9. Each players initial score will be 0 and their selected cards list will also be empty.

Each player will take turns choosing one of the available cards. The first player to have 3 cards that add up to 15 wins. Otherwise the game is a tie. 

Visually the cards in the available cards section and the players' selected cards section should resemble playing cards of the diamond suit. The ace card represents the number 1, the 2 card the number to, and so on. 

Each turn consists of a player selecting a card from the available cards selection. They should only be able to select cards that have not already been selected. When a card is selected by a play, the game will complete the following
1. Check if the card's numeric value will cause the player to have more than 15 points. If so, the card should not be selected and the player should be prompted to select another card.
2. Modify the selected card in the available cards section to show the back of the playing card. The back should display the number of player who selected that card.
3. Add the card that was selected to the selected cards section of the player who selected the card.
4. Update the score for the player who selected the card by adding the number value of the selected card.
5. Check if the player who selected the card has 3 cards that add up to 15. If so, the game is over and the player who won should be visually indicated.

The interface of the game must adhere the highest levels WCAG accessibility standards.  The visual design of the game must be heavily inspired by skeuomorphic design.
