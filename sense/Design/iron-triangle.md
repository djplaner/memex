# Iron Triangle

## Definition

> For example, since quality can be most easily achieved with small to moderate student-to-staﬀ ratios, it is diﬃcult to increase scale without either reducing quality or increasing costs. This concept has been referred to as the Iron Triangle (also known as the triple constraint) (Daniel, Kanwar, and Uvalić-Trumbić 2009; Immerwahr, Johnson, and Gasbarra 2008). The logic of the Iron Triangle implies that the three triangle vertices of access, cost and quality are locked in an unbreakable relationship, such that making changes to one or two of the vertices will inevitably have an impact on the third. (Ryan et al, 2021, p. 1384)

## Beyond the Iron Triangle: improving the quality of teching and learning at scale

Ryan, T., French, S., & Kennedy, G. (2021). Beyond the Iron Triangle: Improving the quality of teaching and learning at scale. Studies in Higher Education, 46(7), 1383–1394. https://doi.org/10.1080/03075079.2019.1679763

**Important** they fall to the promise of AI and smart tools as a promise of offloading administrative and technical support, rather than having "infrastructure" in place to do this

- Examine tensions between mutually conflicting concepts of **access, cost and quality**
- Highlights key strategies that can enhance quality without dramatically inflating costs

_Question_: Why access? Why not scope? Esp. WRT COVID requiring much greater variety in what is required, especially given student calls to have everything?

> A key issue for contemporary higher education, therefore, revolves around the need to maintain the quality of teaching, learning and assessment while teaching at scale.

Four main challenges to quality teaching, learning and assessment 
- The prevalence of poorly designed and delivered lectures
- Impersonal learning experiences
- Impoverished feedback practices
- Reduced student engagement

Six key practical and pedagogical strategies to address those challenges
- High-quality large group teaching and learning
- Alternative curriculum structures
- Automation of assessment and feedback
- Personalising feedback at scale
- Peer-based learning
- Offloading administrative and technical support
