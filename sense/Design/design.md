# Design

Bubble holding misc. thoughts about design.
## Learning design

### General Learning Design

- [[jisc-learning-design]]
- [[automating-instructional-design]]

Curriculum design

- [Enhance student wellbeing](http://unistudentwellbeing.edu.au/) - resources covering policies, curriculum, and learning design that promote student well being.  Based heavily on standard best practices but explicated in some detail.

### ABC Learning Design

  - [[training-learning-paths]]
  - [[design-plus-training]]

## Conceptual

- [[conservation-of-complexity]]
- [[goodyear-shaping-spaces]]
- [[iron-triangle]]
  - [[consistency-quality]] - rather than consistency, maybe it needs to be good?
  - [[scale]]
