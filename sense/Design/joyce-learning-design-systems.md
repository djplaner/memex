# Joyce Learning Design Systems

Notes arising from talk by Joyce Seitzinger "How Learning Design Systems Can Help Scale and Accelerate Learning Design"

Reflections

- The "design system" covers a lot of ground in terms of processes and ways of designing
- Wondering if I'd call it a "design system"
- A focus on serving the "learning designer"

## Joyce's notes

"Design is a plan for arranging element in such a way as best to accomplish a particular purpose" -- Charles Eames

Learning designers in a support role.  Fulfilling the SMEs vision.  Hence issues with variety within a program causing problems from various issues.

Joyce's approach appears to be put the learning designers in charge.  The CASA approach is focused on providing tools that enable forward-oriented design and some level of consistency through that.

But Joyce's approach has to deal with multiple partners from different places.  Rather than an institution.

### Management 3.0

Inspiration for Joyce.  Focus on managing the system, not the people

**Important:** there's a point there.  Echoes with CASA as a way of working.

### Design and design systems

Mention of pedagogical patterns

[Design Systms Handbook](https://www.designbetter.co/design-systems-handbook) - Macro Suares

Joyce framing design system as helping the team.  CASA focusing more on helping the teacher (and student)

ABLE Design System out of OUUK -- actually the name that RMIT Online have used.

  More marketing driven. Does make a case for the cost and time saving. Begs the question of the inefficiency of every single course starting from scratch? But also the huge difference in diversity between a web site components and the components of a course i.e. learning and teaching
