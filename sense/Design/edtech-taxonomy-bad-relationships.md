## Abstract

The iron triangle is a big problem for higher education. Especially in COVID
The need to improve access (diversity), while improving quality and constraining/reducing costs. Iron triangle says you can't do it.
How do you break the iron triangle?
This paper users a collection of theoretical views that emphasise a relational perspective to examine a collection of case studies from institutional LMS migrations to reveal observations that suggest institutions will continue to struggle to break the iron triangle whilst they retain practices based on  atomist perspectives that fail to pay attention to and harness the full power of all relationships


Breaking the iron triangle is a key strategic need for contemporary higher education. Increasingly every institution is trying to figure out how to offer better quality learning opportunitites to more people in more ways at a cheaper cost. But such attempts challenge the widely accepted project management maxim that there exists "iron" constraints between quality, cost, and access. A maxim that suggests any change in one - expanding access - inevitably requires a change in the other two.

Most attempts to improve learning and teaching - improving the digital fluency or pedagogical skills of academics; adopting a new LMS or a new curriculum management system; adopting a new pedagogy; developing a new set of course design principles -  tend to focus on the objects involved in learning and teaching - at atomist view.

This exploratory case study seeks to answer the question: "What is the role of relationships in breaking the iron triangle?"


## Case studies

- I'm not a technology person
- Consistency, confusion and constraint
- Perspectives on design: big-up front, forward-oriented and design-in-use
- Mindsets aka the light-weight development name for this

## Nascent scratch space

### Laissez-faire relationship

i.e. she'll be right. No need to work at the relationship. It just happens.

e.g. in edtech: institutions that adopt principles for L&T without any idea of how to achieve them 

e.g. Ellis and Goodyear (2019) argument that instituitons can identify the what, but don't know the how.

### I'm not a cat person 

i.e. I'm not a technology person, so i can't possibly do that

### All relationships are the same

i.e. lets be consistent
