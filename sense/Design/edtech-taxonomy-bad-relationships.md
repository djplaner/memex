### Laissez-faire relationship

i.e. she'll be right. No need to work at the relationship. It just happens.

e.g. in edtech: institutions that adopt principles for L&T without any idea of how to achieve them 

e.g. Ellis and Goodyear (2019) argument that instituitons can identify the what, but don't know the how.

i.e. I'm not a technology person, so i can't possibly do that

i.e. lets be consistent
