## Abstract

The iron triangle is a big problem for higher education. Especially in COVID
The need to improve access (diversity), while improving quality and constraining/reducing costs. Iron triangle says you can't do it.
How do you break the iron triangle?
This paper users a collection of theoretical views that emphasise a relational perspective to examine a collection of case studies from institutional LMS migrations to reveal observations that suggest institutions will continue to struggle to break the iron triangle whilst they retain practices based on  atomist perspectives that fail to pay attention to and harness the full power of all relationships


It has become strategically important for universities to offer better quality learning opportunitites to more people in more ways at a cheaper cost. Such attempts must break the Iron Triangle. A long acknowledged project management maxim that there exists "iron" constraints between quality, cost, and access. Changing one constraint inevitably requires change in the other two.  Current attempts to break the iron triangle - improving the digital fluency or pedagogical skills of academics; adopting a new LMS or a new curriculum management system; adopting a new pedagogy; developing a new set of course design principles -  tend to focus on the objects involved in learning and teaching. An atomist view, rather than a view focused on the relationships between the objects.  This exploratory case study seeks to answer the question: "What is the role of relationships in breaking the iron triangle?" 

Drawing on experiences from a MLP at a single institution during a LMS migration the paper 
- identifies a collection of relationship types
- describes the observed characteristics of those relationships that enshrine the iron triangle
- analyse how being able to improve those relationships and orchestrate relationships between objects may be key to breaking the iron triangle
- consider what might be required if unviersities are to break the iron triangle
- suggests that limitations of digital fluency/capability is not limited to academics, but to institutions

## Supporting literature

Krause (2022)
> institutional diversity will be more important than ever to meet the diverse needs of students and the labour market (np)
Krause (2022, p12) goes into detail about why this is the case. Work that can be adapted here.

Krause (2022) - may link to the idea that assemblages/activity systems are relationships across silos
> To operate ecosystemically requires a boundary-spanning mindset on the part of leaders, policy makers and the broader community if we are to traverse traditional siloes

## Method 

Explroatory case study?? Three cases

## Conceptual Framework

Should this go here or be embedded in the cases

- Atomist versus relational - general stuff
- Fawn's entangled model
- Dron's educational technology

## Case studies

Actual assemblage development
- Echo360 embed mapping
- CARs and word2Canvas
- canvas-collections

Theoretical/conceptual
- I'm not a technology person
- Consistency, confusion and constraint
- Perspectives on design: big-up front, forward-oriented and design-in-use
- Mindsets aka the light-weight development name for this

### Echo360 embed mapping

Reflections/implications

- LTI is an example of a technology for the specific purpose of connecting two pieces of software Echo360 to an LMS
- It does not fit with the purpose of moving between LMS, purpose mismatch leading to a lot of work for people
- Common in IT for human beings to be called upon to manually modify and move data from one system to another because those technologies don't support the required purpose
- This is where RPA enters the picture - include the workflow automation levels from van der Aalst et al (2018)

### CARs and word2Canvas

Reflections/implications


### canvas-collections

## Nascent scratch space

### Laissez-faire relationship

i.e. she'll be right. No need to work at the relationship. It just happens.

e.g. in edtech: institutions that adopt principles for L&T without any idea of how to achieve them 

e.g. Ellis and Goodyear (2019) argument that instituitons can identify the what, but don't know the how.

### I'm not a cat person 

i.e. I'm not a technology person, so i can't possibly do that

### All relationships are the same

i.e. lets be consistent
