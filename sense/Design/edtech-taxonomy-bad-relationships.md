## Abstract

The iron triangle is a big problem for higher education. Especially in COVID
The need to improve access (diversity), while improving quality and constraining/reducing costs. Iron triangle says you can't do it.
How do you break the iron triangle?
This paper users a collection of theoretical views that emphasise a relational perspective to examine a collection of case studies from institutional LMS migrations to reveal observations that suggest institutions will continue to struggle to break the iron triangle whilst they retain practices based on  atomist perspectives that fail to pay attention to and harness the full power of all relationships


It has become strategically important for universities to offer better quality learning opportunitites to more people in more ways at a cheaper cost. Such attempts must break the Iron Triangle. A long acknowledged project management maxim that there exists "iron" constraints between quality, cost, and access. Changing one constraint inevitably requires change in the other two.  Current attempts to break the iron triangle - improving the digital fluency or pedagogical skills of academics; adopting a new LMS or a new curriculum management system; adopting a new pedagogy; developing a new set of course design principles -  tend to focus on the objects involved in learning and teaching. An atomist view, rather than a view focused on the relationships between the objects.  This exploratory case study seeks to answer the question: "What is the role of relationships in breaking the iron triangle?" 

Drawing on experiences from a MLP at a single institution during a LMS migration the paper 
- identifies a collection of relationship types
- describes the observed characteristics of those relationships that enshrine the iron triangle
- analyse how being able to improve those relationships and orchestrate relationships between objects may be key to breaking the iron triangle
- consider what might be required if unviersities are to break the iron triangle
- suggests that limitations of digital fluency/capability is not limited to academics, but to institutions

## Supporting literature

### Higher Education

#### Diversity

Krause (2022)
> institutional diversity will be more important than ever to meet the diverse needs of students and the labour market (np)
Krause (2022, p12) goes into detail about why this is the case. Work that can be adapted here.

Krause (2022) - may link to the idea that assemblages/activity systems are relationships across silos
> To operate ecosystemically requires a boundary-spanning mindset on the part of leaders, policy makers and the broader community if we are to traverse traditional siloes

#### Third space practitioners

Whitchurch (2008) defines the notion and discusses how its relational, across boundaries etc.  Good framing...to make the point perhaps about crossing boundaries with technology and the nature of orchestration. Sharif et al (2019) touch on the nature of third space professional role as moving through functional and organisational boundaries (breaking the hierarical nature of typical relationships) and "negotiate competing interests, identities, and requiremetns associated with the diverse range of their projects..."

### Learning Objects

Parrish (2004) uses situated perspectives of knowledge to critique the early boosterish views of learning objects. Learning objects are a two decade old attempt to break the iron triangle that were also apparently limited by limited views of knowledge and L&T practice. i.e. the need for and value of customisation. 

Illustration of how the ed tech sphere has not learned from history.

Could bring in discussions about the modularisation of learning materials as having a similar perspective and similar failings.

### Knowledge about IT, algorithms etc 

Cotter (2022) summarises research around "knowledge of algorithms" and moves on to describe "practial knowledge" of algorithms. The linkage here is what do those involved in the migration project (and thus broader ed tech) know about algorithms and technology? How do they approach it as located by this previous work? What implications does this have for how we work and how we break the iron triangle?

There is also some apparent linkage to the idea of "knowledge located in practices"

Linking at some level with the different knowledge regimes between heavyweight and lightweight IT.

From Cotter (2022)
> Through situated encounters, Bucher (2018) suggests, “people learn what they need to know in order to engage meaningfully with and find their way around an algorithmically mediated world” (p. 98). The concept of the algorithmic imaginary, thus, brings together “know that” and “know how,” but further specifies the importance of the specific conditions under which people experience algorithms

There's a lot more here about different ways of knowing and how it involves knowing how "to be". There's an argument to explore here about how inherently most ed designers do not see themselves as technical people. The habitus they work within (more heavyweight IT) is not conducive to the type of activity required to break the iron triangle


## Method 

The aim here is to explore the experience, the context, of a particular situation and in particular explore the relational views of ???

Thomas (2011) identifies two elements of a case study
1. The subject "a practical, historical unity" of the case study - in this case ed designers experience of migration and the challenge of breaking the iron triangle - the aim to illuminate and explicate something interesting
2. The object of the study "an analytical of theoretical frame" - in this case a relational view broadly defined as situated, entangled, and Dron's view of ed tech?

**I may not correctly understand this distinction, I need more thinking**  The next para might be closer to the notion of object

Dron's view of ed tech may provide a way of describing the case - the object. The three "technologies" are orchestration of phenomena for a purpose. Unravel the orchestration of those phenomena may reveal interesting and useful insights about the case. And how, in this case, we broke the iron triangle.

This subject is interesting (me and Griffith migration)
- migration is perhaps the peak time for needing to break the iron triangle, or at least the need for scale 
- I have certain abilities (useful idiot, not a programmer but...) that are somewhat unique but highlight the differences that are possible with a relational view
- it takes advantage of what Thomas (2011) calls "a local knowledge case" providing opportunities for insight but also a need to care.
- arguably it is also an example of Thomas' "outlier case". My skills/abilities are somewhat deviant. An opportunity to see something different.  Thomas (2011) argues that a case study can't be typical or reprentative.

Thomas (2011) uses George and Bennet's (2005) six types of case study. This might be an example of
> 2. Disciplined configurative case studies, where established theories are used to explain a case; 
> 3. Heuristic case studies wherein new causal paths are identified. Outlier cases may be especially valuable here;

Heuristic case studies "can be about arriving at notions of problems to solve" (Thomas 2011). Align with Yin's "representative" case study

A snapshot case study - "examined in one defined period of time: a current event..." in this case first and second dev windows for Griffith's migration.


Tsang (2013) - typology of theorizign from case studies - _contextualised explanation_ (Q4) is seen as strong on contextualising and strong on theory development.  Seems a good fit. Tsang uses Ferner et al (2005) as an example of this. The idea is that such a case study offers a good explanation of the observed empirical behaviour, but it is limited to the context.  That could be the focus, but then questions asked about how well the theories involved offers explanatory power for other insights.

Wynn and Williams (2020)
> Critical Realism has been adopted across the social sciences as a means of providing mechanism-based explanations for phenomena involving human societies and organizations.

Wynn and Williams (2020) most CR-based case studies "coalesce around the search for mechanisms, which implies that there is a corresponding search for structures as well" (p. 54). Which matches the aim here. To explore mechanisms for how the "iron triangle" was broken here. They have more on how 'structure' in CR studies is "the relational conditions underlying behaviour".  The composition and interactions within a context result in "an emergent set of possible actions" which contain/enable the outcomes that may occur

Wynn and Williams (2020) also explain various proposed broad methods and then examine CR case study research in IS
- Almost all focuse on "how" or "why" questions
- 

Cotter (2022)
> I employed an inductive qualitative approach informed by constructivist grounded theory (Charmaz, 2014). That is, while I did not conduct a grounded theory study, I adopted many of its techniques and tenets. This approach served my aim of investigating and giving depth to an underdeveloped domain of empirical inquiry

What data to be used 
- Notes on meetings, experiences
- github commits
- Teams discussions??

Explroatory case study?? Three cases

## Conceptual Framework

this will go early on - perahps in the research method, section before it, or in the introduction 

- Atomist versus relational - general stuff
- Talk about some specific relational views as applied to educational technology
    - Fawn's entangled model
    - Dron's educational technology
- both these get at the idea that orchestration, the assemblage of these different elements and the relationships between them are important
- if applied to the challenge of the iron triangle, then the purpose is lower cost, higher quality, etc.
- how well you're able to orchestrate the phenomena will be important.
- For a LMS migration to "break the iron triangle" then the people involved need to be able to orchestrate the phenomena.
- This is often the job of third space practitioners/ MLPs hence the value in examining this type of case study

### Practice Theory and Sociomaterial perspectives

Fawns et al (2021, p. 361)
> In contrast, practice theory and sociomaterial perspectives (Fenwick, Edwards, and Sawchuck 2011) see learning as embedded in, and shaped by, situated relations between people, discourses and materials. These perspectives have helped researchers cast new light on otherwise mundane phenomena (Sedlačko 2017) by attending to ‘the physicality of human doing, the routine aspects of behaviour, the relevance of tacit knowledge, the significance of material artefacts for behaviour and the effects of explicit and implicit rules’ (Jonas, Littig, and Wroblewski 2017, xv)....they differ radically in their conceptualisations of action, foregrounding the challenge of translating practices of learning, knowing and doing, across complex systems and working environments (Mulcahy 2013). They show that learning is not a commodity that can be mobilised or transferred from one setting to another, since new situations always require new learning, and the adaptation and re-contextualisation of previous knowledge (Hager and Hodkinson 2009).

Touching on the atomistic/individualistic approaches the linkage here is that these perspective not just underpin ideas around learning, but also around how organisational work should be done -- a particular knowledge regime...setting up the idea of lightweight IT as a different knowledge regime and its connection with what's required...Fawns et al (2021, p. 363)
> Our analysis was underpinned by practice theory and sociomaterial perspectives, outlined in the Introduction, enabling understanding emergent forms of learning in complex, fluid settings, within which possible actions are shaped and constrained (Schatzki, Knorr-Cetina, and Von Savigny 2001; Fenwick, Edwards, and Sawchuck 2011). These perspectives trouble the individualist, cognitivist standpoints that have dominated educational approaches (Mulcahy 2014), instead encompassing the collective and relational practices through which professionals enact learning (Fenwick 2014). This orientation helped us to understand the ongoing negotiation and reconciliation of multiple contexts, and forms of academic and practical knowledge, as participants navigated complex environments.

And definitely echoing the simple/complex and predictable/emergent challenge with IT...Fawns et al (2021, p. 370)
> Yet Gough (2013, 1223) warns that constructively aligned curricula will be based on notions of an ‘isolated simple system’. In consequence, what is learned is measured in terms of expected behaviour, rather than in relation to the emergent practices required of unpredictable and complex situations....
> We suggest that routinised disciplinary knowledge (e.g. competencies) is still a crucial aspect of academic professional education, and should contribute to professional accountability. Rather than accepting competencies as guarantees of safe or successful performance in complex practice, however, they might be understood as a necessary basis from which learners must diverge, in ways that are attuned to their varied practice contexts. Accountability, in other words, should encompass the contextualised adaptation of routinised knowledge.

### Focus on Seams

Fawns et al (2021, p. 363)
> we borrowed Vertesi’s (2014) metaphor of seams to represent the messy, often hidden or unarticulated ways of patching together multiple infrastructures and systems. Vertesi (2014) developed her conception of seams from the work of computing design theorists Chalmers and Galani (2004), who proposed that, rather than aiming for seamlessness, in which the different working elements of a system are made invisible (Ratto 2007), exposing the seams between elements could encourage examinations of interdependence, and of ongoing processes of appropriation to suit particular situations. Literature on professional practice and education from sociomaterial and practice theory perspectives (e.g. Fenwick, Edwards, and Sawchuck 2011; Rooney et al. 2015) helped us to relocate Vertesi’s work from a remote context (a space station) to the professional education contexts of our participants....
> For us, seams imply a less stable and clear-cut interface than boundaries. They are contingent on the work of people, in conjunction with materials and devices, to align and make sense of multiple contexts (Vertesi 2014). Accordingly, we came to consider the negotiation of academic and professional contexts as ‘less a question of boundary work as…a kind of ad hoc patchwork’ (269). However, as Vertesi observed, people still use seams to construct temporary boundaries via various exclusions and inclusions, achieved through technological and social means. This produces sub-spaces of localised and constrained activity (Vertesi 2014, 276).

Link to bricolage Fawns et al (2021, p. 371)
> In using seamfulness as an analytic concept, Vertesi (2014) recommended thinking through the constraints of infrastructures, while observing how people, rather than producing stable and coherent systems, craft ‘fleeting moments of alignment suited to particular tasks with materials ready-to-hand’ (268).

And a possible link to Dron's view of educational technology 
> On the other hand, Vertesi suggested that failures to knot systems together successfully can illuminate the otherwise obscured infrastructural elements and relations essential to the task at hand. Jane’s lack of a ‘chair to sit on’ or an accessible computer constitute more than a problem to be solved by finding resources. These challenges are entangled in the wider infrastructural provision of space and resources, social hierarchies, the preparation of professionals and the working environment for the incorporation of new, junior colleagues

### Good teaching as subversion of the system - perhaps in the discussion

[Fawns tweet](https://twitter.com/timbocop/status/1504746260405932034) about education "an ever-increasingly bureaucratic system of fixes to other fixes (each intervention or change is a response to a problem caused by a previous change)" and subsequent discussion.  Position this work - light-weight IT - as an echo of that.  Adoption of limited technology (e.g. Canvas, Echo360 etc) is an example

But also echoes of what people within education systems are already doing. With a particular focus on educating the professions and how much of this experience is what they see happening and actually necessary to happen within the professions. Suggesting that universities - in their own practice - also need to demonstrate this, recognise it and integrate it (see below)..Fawns et al (2021, p. 368)
> Students, practitioners and educators all spoke of improvisations and uses of technologies as inadvertent learning tools, and how this was caught up in learning and practising as a professional.
> ..._and now p 369_ Our participants described complex forms of skill or knowledge involved in dealing with
available or imposed technologies.

Fawns et al (2021, p. 360)
> Somewhere between developing pre-specified, discipline-based skills and knowledge, and adapting to situated, contextualised conditions, there must be a capacity for dynamically developing unpredictable practices

Fawns et al (2021, p. 369) talks about what is required of graduates of professional education
> They recognised that this required going beyond competence, to the development of what might be called _adaptive capacity_. Where competence is a clearly-bound, individualised, prescriptive and demonstrable accomplishment of a performance standard, adaptive capacity is an _always-developing_ potential to integrate into, and shape, teams, systems and settings. It is distinguished from notions of adaptive expertise (e.g. Hatano and Inagak 1986) by its emphasis on collective and relational practice. In adaptive capacity, relational agency is prioritised over performances. It is what allows learners to negotiate new sociomaterial situations, by being accomplished not only in predictable, regular patterns of practice but also in developing emergent practices as required



## Case studies

Actual assemblage development
- Echo360 embed mapping
- CARs and word2Canvas
- canvas-collections

Theoretical/conceptual
- I'm not a technology person
- Consistency, confusion and constraint
- Perspectives on design: big-up front, forward-oriented and design-in-use
- Mindsets aka the light-weight development name for this

### Echo360 embed mapping

Reflections/implications

- LTI is an example of a technology for the specific purpose of connecting two pieces of software Echo360 to an LMS
- It does not fit with the purpose of moving between LMS, purpose mismatch leading to a lot of work for people
- Common in IT for human beings to be called upon to manually modify and move data from one system to another because those technologies don't support the required purpose
- This is where RPA enters the picture - include the workflow automation levels from van der Aalst et al (2018)
- Allow workers to orchestrate phenemona for their own purpose
- Something about the impact on staffing and skills - low level helpdesk versus folk a few rungs up the ladder

### CARs and word2Canvas

Wonder how the local development here of word2Canvas might be a good thing.  Get the MLOs/Designers involved.

Reflections/implications

- SCORM packages are another example of standards for moving from one system to another
- To do this they have to target the lowest level denominator
- Do not recogise the systems can have very different structures/approaches
- Don't allow anyspace for the user to input effort
- Again no recognition that the purpose here is different, want the designer/the MLO to have a chance to embed 
- Also a need to respond creatively to different learning designs (e.g. Content Interface)
- technology gets better as it is assembled into broader hierarchies (Dron)

### canvas-collections

Reflections/implications
- Program or be programmed
- Long history of Canvas not giving people what they wanted, even at simple levels
- This oversight clashed directly with espoused aims of the strategic project

## Discussion and reflections

### Ed design needs a relational view of technology OR Design is technical orchestration?

"design" is often seen as non-technical. Knowing which buttons to press is often looked upon askance by senior designers, academics and institutional leaders. If there must be a hierarchy, then perhaps it is the naive atomistic view that separates pedagogy and technology that should be at the bottom for when it comes to breaking the iron triangle. It is not about how good your pedagogy is, or how good your technology is. Instead, what's important is how well you can orchestrate these different phenomena into a technology the better serves your specific purpose. If "fit-for-purpose" is the stated goal (c.f. Krause 2022) then it is this orchestration capability that is key to achieving that goal. Especially if you're looking for diversity, quality and reduced cost.

### Emergent/ateleological/contextual??/lightweight

Somethign about RPA responding/enabling local agency. It's not about central control. Teleological processess are not sufficient

### Activity Systems

Ellis and Goodyear (2019) quote about a minimal set of ??

But what's important is the process of creating and maintaing those

[Tweet thread on XP](https://twitter.com/ekapic/status/1503649925137149953)
> An excellent metaphor to define XP:
> "Driving is not about getting the car going in the right direction. Driving is about constantly paying attention, making a little correction this way, a little correction that way." 
> This is the paradigm for XP. Stay aware. Adapt. Change.
> ----
> CHANGE, AWARENESS and ADAPTABILITY are the key factors here.
>   Change = always happening
>   Awareness = a trigger
>   Adaptability = an answer to the change
> Result: "Software...developed at lower cost, with fewer defects, with higher productivity, and with much higher ROI"

## Reflections

Scratch space for the types of major reflections I might want to takes

### Technology standards: The paucity of relationships: 

Relationships between technologies are typically defined by standards e.g. LTI and SCORM. These are commonly relied upon during tasks such as LMS migration. Illustrations of those limitations
- Echo360 LTI only talk between one LMS and echo360, not portable between them
- SCORM decontextualises and provides little or no capability for adaptation or easy customisation (e.g. the word2canvas question)...this links into orchestration

### Primitive, manual orchestration - limited insitutional digital fluency

The relationships typically relied upon - e.g. technology standards - end up requiring a lot of manual orchestration.

Educational technology is the ability to orchestrate the different technologies (pedagogy etc) into something that is fit-for-purpose. The cases above illustrate where manual orchestration has led to situations where the resulting technology is somewhat less than fit-for-purpose.

Whereas the ability to use technology to automate orchestration leads to better resulting technology...should make a point in here about technology being hierarchical.

...this is also where RPA could be brought in to illustrate how the digital fluency or organisational L&T is somewhat less than what is observered elsewhere e.g. Griffith's projects

### hard and soft technologies: a major hold on breaking the iron triangle

Connect with Dron's identification of hard technologies. In the absence of the ability to orchestrate we see these constraints being put on the quality of what can be achieved. e.g. Canvas collections and findability....and more

Could also bring Zittrains generarative and sterile technologies. And also ?? "Program or be programmed" to explain the direction higher education is taken.  This also connects to Macgilchrist et al's critique embedded in envisioning likely futures.
And also [this tweet](https://twitter.com/thomhillman/status/1509773871901196289)

### What's required? Light-weight orchestration IT development??

Riff on the different knowledge regime. The iterative nature of this. The need to empower.

## Nascent scratch space

### Laissez-faire relationship

i.e. she'll be right. No need to work at the relationship. It just happens.

e.g. in edtech: institutions that adopt principles for L&T without any idea of how to achieve them 

e.g. Ellis and Goodyear (2019) argument that instituitons can identify the what, but don't know the how.

### I'm not a cat person 

i.e. I'm not a technology person, so i can't possibly do that

### All relationships are the same

i.e. lets be consistent
