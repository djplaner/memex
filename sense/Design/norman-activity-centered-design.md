> The more something is tailored for the particular likes, dislikes, skills, and needs of a particular target population, the less likely it will be appropriate for others.

Perhaps a link/need here for enabling co-configuration. 
## [Activity centered design - some thoughts](https://ebiinterfaces.wordpress.com/2013/03/13/activity-centered-design-some-thoughts/)

Origins in activity theory
> It is a high-level view of tasks and goals and clearly does not focus on “the user” as an individual unit. Instead, it gives us a framework in which to consider what people do, or what we want them to be able to do, in a more-or-less general sense. This can be a very attractive perspective to take in situations where the user-base is very diverse, the goals are varied, but the broad activities are less numerous and easier to define.

Positions ACD as a wider angle lens (a different lens) than HCD.

Offers simplified version of Engstrom's diagram

Mentions issues with personas being good for generating empathy but tending to become "too general to represent any real-life customer"

 Wonder how Goodyear positions ACAD against Engstroms activity systems ideas
