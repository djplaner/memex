# Meso-level 

See also: [[design]]

Important concept that crops up in institutional L&T literature and often usefully describes the work I do.

## Conole & Jones (2010)

| Level | Description | L&T |
| --- | --- |
| Macro | Large-scale policy and institutional processes | Infrastructural changes |
| Meso |  Where bottom-up meets top-down (Liljenstrom & Svedin, 2005)  | Organisational sub-units and course teams in the OUUK context |
| Micro |  Small-scale, local interaction  | day-to-day enactment of courses - actual L&T with students |
