# Canvas models

Attempt to distill the models that underpin Canvas

## Misc notes

- Canvas does not have folders - uses Modules and Pages to organise content and assessments
- Rich Text Editor strips Javascript - ??workaround??

## [Thinking in Canvas](https://educational-innovation.sydney.edu.au/teaching@sydney/thinking-in-canvas/) Danny Liu's intro from USyd

- pages
    -  primary way to provide content 
    -  has version control
    -  permissions on pages is flexible e.g. students can be given edit access
    -  pages are used to embed all things, including Canvas features???

- modules - as the new organiser
    - replacement for folders
    - provide a linear pathway through a unit 
    - also provide the conditional release ability

## Modules

Intended to make organisation and navigation easier [source](https://sites.rmit.edu.au/sister/2020/06/29/designing-a-module-in-canvas/). A focus on creating flow.

## Templates

- [Canvas style guides (deprecated?)](https://griffith.instructure.com/styleguide) being replaced by [some REACT thing](https://instructure.design/)
- [Three approaches to creating a Canvas template](https://www.unicon.net/insights/articles/three-approaches-to-creating-a-canvas-template)
- e.g. [USyd](https://lx.uts.edu.au/collections/examples-canvas-sites/resources/how-can-i-structure-my-canvas-subject-site-effectively/) provides templates for pages in Canvas

## Work arounds

- Apparently embedding web pages from a secure server is one workaround [source](https://wordpress.miracosta.edu/joyfulteaching/2017/07/22/lisas-dozen-tips-for-canvas/)
