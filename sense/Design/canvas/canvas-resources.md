## Canvas Hacks

- [5 Canvas hacks you can't live without](https://www.leveragingelearning.com/lelblog/5canvashacks) - awful overly promotional pages
- [CanvasHacks Demo Course](https://resources.instructure.com/courses/443) - demo course that introduces various approaches, from very simple to more advanced.  But not really coding level??

[Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Y-BxHO2KZdFUkVmfePrfmVpZm4kMa3iTRz9adHyuKcM/edit#slide=id.p)

- Apparently Canvas is "built for the web", will the institution allow this
- **Let sub-accounts define additional includes** - will this be useful
- Basically an "how to" to include your own javascript with a little on "why"
