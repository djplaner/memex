    - [Simple Python get script](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Developers-Group/A-Simple-Python-GET-Script/ba-p/273742) - basic tutorial - fairly limited
    - [Get started with the Canvas API](https://learninganalytics.ubc.ca/for-students/canvas-api/) - from UBC - much better
        - the initial api URL used in this doesn't appear to work    
    - [Canvas APIs: Getting started](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Developers-Group/Canvas-APIs-Getting-started-the-practical-ins-and-outs-gotchas/ba-p/263685) - better intro, quite detailed
