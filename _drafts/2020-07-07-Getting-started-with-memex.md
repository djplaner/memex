So [memex][1] is up and going. Time to start using it and as I go figuring out the workflow and toolchain to use.

Aims for this post include

1.  Writing this post in memex and syncing to my blog
2.  Adding some "zettels" to sense taken from [my wikity][2]

## Writing blog posts in memex

One of the assumptions of Foam is that the authoing environment (VSCode/markdown) can be a positive writing experience. I'm not such a fan of markedown. Writing blog posts in Foam will help me explore/change that in addition to all the benefits of [POSSE][3] and Foam.

The hope is that the [Wordpress GitHub sync plugin][4] for Wordpress will help.

Installation seems to have worked, but I've decided not to import existing posts here. Start afresh.

May as well test this now.
