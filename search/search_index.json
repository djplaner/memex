Khan Academy have leveraged this to integrate </p> <p>For me, Khan Academy's use of OpenAI's LLMs is a good example of gathering and weaving. In particular, strong example of how LLMs allow that gathering and weaving to move up a few layers of abstraction. For example, by integrating pedagogical knowledge into prompts (e.g. good tutor practices) so the LLM does this. In ways that aren't normally accessible either because the tutor isn't available or doesn't have the knowledge.</p> <p>For example, the \"Tutor me\" mode in Khanmigo is reportedly \"very good at guiding the tutoring process by providing tailored scaffolding support, asking probing questions, prompting critical thinking\". Arguably, because the work Khan Academy does on prompt engineering. In particular, prompting the LLM to act as a tutor and draw upon published research on tutoring practices (Graesser et al, 1995). Achieved by prompting the LLM with the academic reference.</p> <p>Key to the performance of the LLM is the bespoke prompt engineering that is done by Khan Academy.

There are many models available, but the most powerful to date are called GPT-3.5 and GPT4, made by OpenAI.</p> <p>The tool is chat-based, which means after the first completion, you can provide another prompt, receive another completion, and so on. The power of this prompt-completion-prompt-completion-\u2026 cycle is that you can interact with the AI to improve upon its responses.

Little did I know, I found this effective because of retrieval practice.</p> <p>A standard approach to giving students activities for retrieval practice is the humble quiz. Generative AI can help you generate draft questions quickly. It can even suggest feedback to provide to students. The prompt below asks AI to generate some of these for you. The prompt is colour-coded to demonstrate how role (blue), task (orange), requirements (green), and instructions (purple) come together.

Try spice up the prompt by asking ChatGPT to write the feedback in different ways.</p> <p>Identify the correct option to the MCQ below. Write feedback for each of the options.</p> <p> <p>Often a criticism of MCQs is that they focus on recall, or lower level skills.

You have successfully balanced the diversity and complexity of designing and supporting high quality learning experiences with the limitations of institutional policy and infrastructure. What are the principles you've found most useful in achieving this success? Please link your principles to scholarly research and theoretical concepts.</p> <p>ChatGPT</p> <p>As an experienced meso-level learning and teaching practitioner in higher education, I have found several principles to be useful in achieving success while balancing the diversity and complexity of designing and supporting high-quality learning experiences with institutional policy and infrastructure. These principles are supported by scholarly research and theoretical concepts in the field of education. Here are some of the key principles:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Learner-Centered Approach: A learner-centered approach places the learner at the center of the educational experience, focusing on their needs, interests, and goals. This principle is supported by constructivist theories of learning, such as those proposed by Vygotsky and Piaget, which emphasize the active construction of knowledge by learners. Research by Bransford, Brown, and Cocking (2000) in their book \"How People Learn\" provides insights into effective learner-centered practices.</p> </li> <li> <p>Authentic Learning: Authentic learning experiences connect classroom learning to real-world contexts, tasks, and problems. This principle is based on the theory of situated cognition, which suggests that learning is most effective when situated in authentic and meaningful contexts. The work of Lave and Wenger (1991) on communities of practice is an important theoretical foundation for authentic learning. Additionally, Herrington and Oliver (2000) have conducted research on authentic learning environments.</p> </li> <li> <p>Active Learning: Active learning approaches engage students in active participation, such as discussions, problem-solving, and hands-on activities. Active learning is supported by cognitive theories of learning, including the work of Ausubel (1968) on meaningful learning and the information processing theory. Research by Freeman et al. (2014) conducted a meta-analysis of studies comparing active learning to traditional lecture-based approaches, demonstrating the effectiveness of active learning strategies.</p> </li> <li> <p>Technology Integration: Integrating technology in meaningful ways can enhance learning experiences and promote engagement. This principle aligns with the concept of the TPACK framework (Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge), which emphasizes the importance of integrating technology, pedagogy, and content knowledge. The work of Mishra and Koehler (2006) provides theoretical foundations for the TPACK framework. Additionally, research by Hattie (2009) explores the impact of technology on student learning.</p> </li> <li> <p>Assessment for Learning: Assessment practices should support and enhance learning rather than merely measuring it. This principle is supported by the research on formative assessment, which emphasizes the use of ongoing feedback and assessment to guide instruction and improve learning. The work of Black and Wiliam (1998) on formative assessment and the concept of assessment for learning are foundational to this principle.</p> </li> <li> <p>Collaboration and Social Learning: Collaborative learning experiences promote active engagement, peer interaction, and knowledge construction through social interaction. This principle aligns with social constructivist theories, such as those proposed by Vygotsky, which emphasize the role of social interaction in learning. Research by Johnson and Johnson (1989) on cooperative learning and Wenger's (1998) work on communities of practice support the value of collaboration and social learning.</p> </li> </ol> <p>These principles provide a foundation for designing and supporting high-quality learning experiences while considering the diversity and complexity of higher education contexts. While the specific implementation of these principles may vary depending on institutional policies and infrastructure, they offer valuable guidance for enhancing teaching and learning in higher education.</p> <p>QLoRA</p> <p>As an AI language model trained on text data, I don\u2019t have personal experience as a meso-level learning and teaching practitioner or any specific knowledge about the nuances of higher education institutions. However, based on my understanding of the question, here are some principles that could be relevant for achieving success in balancing diversity, complexity, constraints, and outcomes at this level:</p> <ol> <li>Student-centeredness: Designing and delivering courses and programs that meet students\u2019 needs and expectations is essential. This includes considering diverse student characteristics such as prior experience, cultural background, motivation, and individual goals.</li> <li>Flexibility: Recognizing that one size does not fit all and being open to adapting approaches and resources to different contexts can help accommodate diversity while maintaining high standards.  </li> <li>Collaboration: Working closely with colleagues from across disciplines and units to share ideas, resources, and best practices can lead to more innovative solutions and better outcomes. Collaborating with students and other stakeholders can also provide valuable insights into their perspectives and needs.  </li> <li>Accessibility: Ensuring that materials, technologies, and physical spaces are accessible to people with disabilities and others who may need additional support is critical for creating equitable learning environments.  </li> <li>Integrated assessment: Using multiple methods of assessment that align with course objectives and program outcomes can give a holistic picture of students\u2019 progress and achievement. Feedback should be timely, constructive, and actionable to facilitate continuous improvement.  </li> <li>Reflection: Regular self-evaluation and reflection on practice can help identify strengths and areas for development. Engaging in peer review processes and participating in professional development activities can foster continual growth and innovation.  </li> <li>Evidence-based decision making: Making informed decisions by using evidence-based research and evaluation is crucial when designing new initiatives or revising existing ones. Considering both quantitative and qualitative data sources can provide a deeper understanding of what works well and why.  </li> <li>Leadership: Demonstrating effective leadership skills can inspire others, build trust, and create a positive culture of collaboration and change. Strong communication, active listening, empathy, and conflict resolution skills are key attributes for successful leaders.  </li> <li>Sustainability: Implementing sustainable practices that promote environmental responsibility, social justice, and economic viability can contribute to long-term success. Considering ethical implications of actions and decisions is essential for ensuring accountability and impact. These principles are grounded in various theories and research related to learner-centered pedagogy, collaborative inquiry, universal design for learning, accessibility, assessment for learning, reflective practice, educational leadership, and sustainability. By weaving these principles into daily practice, meso-level learning and teaching practitioners can work toward creating meaningful and transformational learning experiences for students and contributing to the advancement of their profession.</li> </ol> <p>You've provided a good selection of learning theories to help guide practice, but nothing that talks about how you overcome the difficulty involved in translating those theories into concrete online and face-to-face learning activities and environments that are 1) appropriate for hundreds of very diverse learners, 2) appropriate for a specific content area, 3) possible to sustainably implement using limited institutional infrastructure and the technical and design knowledge of a typical academic.  What practices do you use to support this type of forward-oriented design of learning and learning environments?</p> <p>ChatGPT</p> <p>To support the forward-oriented-design of learning and learning environments that are appropriate for diverse learners, specific content areas, and feasible within institutional constraints, there are several practices I employ. These practices help bridge the gap between learning theories and the practical implementation of effective learning activities and environments. Here are some key practices:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Needs Assessment and Learner Analysis: Conducting a thorough needs assessment and learner analysis is crucial to understanding the characteristics, prior knowledge, and learning needs of the diverse student population. This involves gathering data through surveys, interviews, or focus groups to identify learner preferences, challenges, and goals. By gaining insights into the learners' context and requirements, I can tailor the learning activities and environments to better meet their needs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Backward Design: Applying the backward design framework, as proposed by Wiggins and McTighe (2005), helps ensure that the design of learning experiences is aligned with desired learning outcomes. Starting with clearly defined learning objectives, I work backward to determine the most appropriate learning activities and assessments that support those objectives. This approach helps maintain a focus on essential content while considering the diversity of learners.</p> </li> <li> <p>Universal Design for Learning (UDL): UDL principles guide the design of flexible learning environments that accommodate the diverse needs and preferences of learners. UDL encourages the provision of multiple means of representation, expression, and engagement. By incorporating various media formats, providing options for demonstrating understanding, and offering diverse ways to engage with the content, UDL helps create inclusive learning experiences. The Center for Applied Special Technology (CAST) provides valuable resources on UDL implementation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Blended Learning: Adopting a blended learning approach, which combines online and face-to-face elements, can address the challenges of both diversity and limited institutional infrastructure. Blended learning allows for a mix of synchronous and asynchronous activities, leveraging the advantages of both modalities. Online components provide flexibility, accessibility, and opportunities for self-paced learning, while face-to-face interactions support social engagement and deeper discussions. The Community of Inquiry framework (Garrison, Anderson, &amp; Archer, 2000) is a theoretical foundation for blended learning design.</p> </li> <li> <p>Learning Design Models and Templates: Utilizing established learning design models and templates can facilitate the creation of effective learning activities and environments. Models like the ADDIE (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, Evaluation) or the SAM (Successive Approximation Model) provide structured frameworks for instructional design, helping to ensure systematic and coherent development of learning experiences. These models can guide academics in organizing their design efforts and efficiently using limited institutional resources.</p> </li> <li> <p>Collaborative Learning Communities: Fostering collaborative learning communities among academics and instructional designers can support the sharing of ideas, resources, and best practices. By collaborating with colleagues, leveraging their expertise, and engaging in peer review processes, academics can collectively address the challenges of designing learning activities and environments. Participating in professional development workshops, conferences, or online communities can further facilitate knowledge exchange and support.</p> </li> <li> <p>Iterative Improvement and Evaluation: Designing learning experiences is an iterative process that involves continuous improvement based on feedback and evaluation. Collecting feedback from students, analyzing learning outcomes, and reflecting on the effectiveness of instructional strategies allow for ongoing refinement of the learning activities and environments. Techniques such as course evaluations, surveys, and assessments can provide valuable insights for evidence-based decision-making and improvement.</p> </li> </ol> <p>By employing these practices, academics can navigate the complexities of translating learning theories into concrete learning activities and environments that are appropriate for diverse learners, specific content areas, and feasible within institutional constraints. The goal is to foster effective and engaging learning experiences while leveraging available resources and expertise.</p> <p>QLoRA</p> <p>Here are some practical strategies that might help translate theory into concrete learning activities and environments:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Establish clear goals: Start by clearly defining the desired outcomes for each course or program. Keep them aligned with broader institutional goals and ensure they are measurable so you can track progress and make improvements over time.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use backwards design: Begin with the end in mind. Reverse engineer the learning process starting from the final goal and working backward through smaller objectives until you reach the initial activity. This will help you map out a logical progression and avoid unnecessary detours.</p> </li> <li> <p>Involve students in the design process: Seek input from students throughout the design cycle. Their feedback can highlight gaps in understanding and suggest creative solutions. Encourage them to co-create assignments, evaluate peers\u2019 work, and engage in project-based learning where possible.</p> </li> <li> <p>Utilize UDL principles: Universal Design for Learning (UDL) is an inclusive approach to instruction that provides multiple ways for students to access information, demonstrate their learning, and engage with the material. It can be applied to both digital and traditional classroom settings. For example, incorporating multimedia elements like audio/video clips, interactive simulations, and visual organizers can improve comprehension and retention for diverse learners.</p> </li> <li> <p>Embrace active learning techniques: Get students actively engaged in the learning process rather than just passively receiving information. This can include anything from group projects and case studies to role-playing exercises and debates. These types of hands-on experiences often result in deeper understanding and greater satisfaction for students.</p> </li> <li> <p>Encourage experimentation: Be willing to try new things and iterate frequently. Use formative evaluations to gather early feedback from students and adjust accordingly. Leverage available technology tools and platforms to streamline workflows and enhance the overall learning experience.</p> </li> <li> <p>Build partnerships: Work with colleagues, mentors, and industry experts to leverage their unique perspectives and skill sets. Collaborate with IT staff and instructional designers to develop customized solutions that address specific challenges. Establish connections with alumni and employers to gain insight into current trends and future opportunities.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Based on this what principled advice would you give to senior management at your university about how they can help? What changes should they consider to better support you? </p> <p>ChatGPT</p> <p>If I were to provide principled advice to senior management at a university on how they can better support academics in designing and implementing effective learning experiences, here are some changes they should consider:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Recognize and Value Pedagogical Expertise: Senior management should acknowledge and value the pedagogical expertise of academics. This recognition can be manifested through institutional policies, support structures, and promotion criteria that prioritize teaching excellence and innovation alongside research output. It is essential to foster a culture where teaching and learning are seen as integral to the mission of the university.</p> </li> <li> <p>Invest in Professional Development: Providing robust and ongoing professional development opportunities for academics is crucial. Senior management should allocate resources to support faculty in enhancing their pedagogical knowledge and skills. This can include funding for attending conferences, workshops, and training programs focused on effective teaching practices, learning technologies, and instructional design. Additionally, establishing a community of practice or a center for teaching and learning can facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing among academics.</p> </li> <li> <p>Build Technical and Design Support: Recognizing the limited technical and design knowledge of typical academics, senior management should invest in dedicated technical and design support teams. These teams can provide guidance and assistance in leveraging educational technologies, developing multimedia resources, and designing interactive learning experiences. Having accessible technical support can alleviate the burden on academics and help them create high-quality learning environments.</p> </li> <li> <p>Establish Collaborative Spaces and Resources: Senior management should create physical and virtual spaces that foster collaboration and resource sharing among academics. These spaces can be designed for cross-disciplinary dialogue, the exchange of best practices, and the creation of a supportive learning community. Additionally, providing access to a repository of teaching resources, exemplars, and case studies can facilitate the sharing of effective instructional strategies and materials.</p> </li> <li> <p>Encourage Research on Teaching and Learning: Senior management should promote and support research on teaching and learning within the institution. This can involve creating incentives, funding opportunities, and dedicated research positions or grants focused on pedagogical scholarship. Encouraging academics to engage in research on effective teaching practices and assessment strategies can contribute to the evidence base for informed decision-making and continuous improvement.</p> </li> <li> <p>Foster Collaborative Decision-Making: Involve academics in decision-making processes related to teaching and learning. Establish mechanisms such as faculty committees or advisory boards where academics can contribute their expertise and perspectives on matters of curriculum design, instructional policies, and learning technologies. By including academics in these discussions, senior management can ensure that decisions align with the needs and realities of the teaching and learning context.</p> </li> <li> <p>Provide Adequate Resources and Support: Senior management should allocate sufficient resources to support academics in their teaching endeavors. This includes providing access to modern learning technologies, sufficient funding for instructional materials and resources, and appropriate physical spaces for teaching and collaboration. Additionally, ensuring manageable teaching workloads and recognizing the time required for course preparation, innovation, and assessment can contribute to the quality of learning experiences.</p> </li> </ol> <p>By considering and implementing these changes, senior management can provide better support to academics in their efforts to design and deliver high-quality learning experiences. Recognizing and valuing teaching expertise, investing in professional development, and providing technical and design support are crucial steps towards creating an environment that fosters effective teaching and learning at the university.</p> <p>QLoRA</p> <p>Here are a few suggestions based on the previous discussion: - Support faculty development: Provide resources and training opportunities for faculty members to stay up-to-date with best practices in education and emerging technologies. Offer workshops, conferences, and online courses to help them hone their skills and explore new approaches to teaching and learning. Invest in faculty development programs that prioritize pedagogical innovation and encourage interdisciplinary collaboration.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Provide adequate funding: Ensure that sufficient financial resources are allocated to support the implementation of new teaching models and technological tools. Budget for equipment, software, and personnel needed to maintain high quality standards across all departments and disciplines. Create incentives for faculty members who are committed to improving student outcomes and adopting innovative methods.</p> </li> <li> <p>Promote a culture of openness: Foster a culture that values diversity and encourages sharing of ideas and best practices among faculty members. Encourage cross-departmental collaboration and facilitate the exchange of knowledge between different fields. Emphasize the importance of continuous improvement and recognize achievements made by individuals and teams.</p> </li> <li> <p>Prioritize accessibility: Make sure that all learning materials and resources are accessible to students with disabilities. Procure assistive technology, train staff on its usage, and establish protocols for accommodations.

You should always illustrate the relevance with examples that are likely to excite and motivate a 15 year old.</p> <p>Response</p> <p>Hey! I totally get that math isn't everyone's favorite subject, but trust me, understanding ratios, fractions, and percentages can be really helpful in your everyday life, and even in your future career. Let me explain why!</p> <p>First of all, think about all the times you go shopping and see a discount advertised. If you don't understand percentages, you might not realize how much money you're really saving, and you could end up spending more than you intended. But if you know how to calculate percentages, you can make smarter shopping decisions and save yourself some cash.</p> <p>And speaking of money, understanding fractions is also really important when it comes to managing your finances. Let's say you want to split a pizza with your friends and you each want to pay an equal amount. If you don't know how to divide fractions, you might have trouble figuring out how much each person owes. But if you do know how to divide fractions, you can easily split the cost and avoid any awkward arguments.</p> <p>Now, let's talk about ratios. Have you ever followed a recipe to make a delicious cake or a batch of cookies? If so, you were using ratios without even realizing it! Recipes give you instructions on how much of each ingredient to use, and those instructions are based on ratios. Understanding ratios can help you make the perfect cake every time, and it can also be helpful if you're interested in pursuing a career in cooking or baking.</p> <p>But it's not just cooking that uses ratios. Architects, engineers, and many other professionals use ratios in their work too. For example, an architect might need to create a scale model of a building, which requires understanding ratios and proportions. Even if you don't plan on pursuing a career in these fields, understanding ratios, fractions, and percentages can help you develop problem-solving skills and logical reasoning abilities that are valuable in any career.</p> <p>So, as you can see, math really does have relevance to your future life! Whether you're shopping, cooking, or pursuing a career, understanding ratios, fractions, and percentages can make a big difference. Plus, it's always satisfying to be able to solve a tricky math problem and know that you have those skills in your toolkit!</p>"},{"location":"sense/AI/explorations/first-llm-api-experiments.html#priming-with-literature","title":"Priming with literature","text":"<p>Prompt</p> <p>What scholarly literature can you recommend that can offer insight into either of these two questions: a) why teenagers do not find math intrinsically interesting, or b) how to improve their intrinsic interest in mathematics</p> <p>Response</p> <p>As an AI language model, I don't have personal preferences or beliefs, but I can suggest some scholarly literature related to your questions.

You are quite good at mathematics, especially at connecting mathematical concepts to your friends. You are chatting with one your 15 year old friends who hates mathematics. Doesn't see the relevance of it to his future life.  Explain to him the relevance of learning about ratio, fractions and percentages. You should always illustrate the relevance with examples that are likely to excite and motivate a 15 year old.</p> <p>Response</p> <p>Hey, I know you hate maths, but trust me, it's not as boring as you think. Maths is everywhere in our lives, and learning about ratio, fractions and percentages can help you understand many things better. Let me give you some examples.</p> <ul> <li>Do you like baking? I love making cakes and cookies. But sometimes I need to adjust the recipe depending on how many people I want to serve. That's where ratio and fractions come in handy. For example, if the recipe says I need 2 cups of flour for 12 muffins, but I only want to make 6 muffins, I can use a ratio of 2:12 to find out how much flour I need for 6 muffins. It's just 2 divided by 12 times 6, which is 1 cup. Or I can use fractions and say that 6 is half of 12, so I need half of 2 cups of flour, which is also 1 cup. See? It's easy and useful!</li> <li>Do you like shopping? I love buying new clothes and accessories. But sometimes I need to compare prices and discounts to find the best deal. That's where percentages come in handy. For example, if a shirt costs $50 and it's on sale for 20% off, I can use percentages to find out how much I save and how much I pay. It's just 20% of 50, which is 10. So I save $10 and pay $40. Or if a pair of jeans costs $80 and it's on sale for $60, I can use percentages to find out how much discount I get. It's just (80-60) divided by 80 times 100, which is 25%. So I get a 25% discount. See? It's easy and useful!</li> <li>Do you like gaming? I love playing video games and online games. But sometimes I need to calculate my chances of winning or losing, or how much damage I can do or take. That's where ratio, fractions and percentages come in handy again. For example, if I have a weapon that has a 30% chance of hitting a critical hit, I can use ratio to find out how many critical hits I can expect in 10 attacks. It's just 30:100 times 10, which is 3. So I can expect 3 critical hits in 10 attacks. Or if I have a shield that reduces damage by half, I can use fractions to find out how much damage I take from an attack that does 100 damage. It's just half of 100, which is 50. So I take 50 damage from the attack. Or if I have a health bar that shows how much health I have left as a percentage, I can use percentages to find out how many hits I can survive from an attack that does 50 damage. It's just my current health divided by 50 times 100. For example, if my current health is 150, it's just 150 divided by 50 times 100, which is 300%. So I can survive three hits from the attack. See? It's easy and useful!</li> </ul> <p>I hope these examples show you that maths is not just boring numbers and symbols, but a way of understanding and enjoying the world around us. Ratio, fractions and percentages are some of the most basic and important concepts in maths, and they can help you with many things in life. So don't give up on maths, give it a try!

Because ICT is now so everyday and raising awareness of hybridity. That it's both digital and analogue, virtual and real. Better to understand \"the tools and infrastructures used by people in L&amp;T\" as \"assemblages or networks of people and things: material, digital and hybrid\".</p> <p>The ICT focus also fails to bring to the fore the \"critical and emancipatory\" commitments in the NGL literature.</p> <p>For Illich, tools included \"all rationally designed devices, be they artifacts or rules, codes or operators... School curricula or marriage laws are no less purposely shaped social devices than road networks\"</p> <p>Convivial tools stand in contrast to tools produced by centrally or hierarchically managed societies filled with \"obedient workers and consumers\"</p> <p>Convivial tools are those which give each person who uses them the greatest opportunity to enrich the environment with the fruits of his or her vision. Industrial tools deny this possibility to those who use them and they allow their designers to determine the meaning and expectations of others. Most tools today cannot be used in a convivial fashion (Illich, 1973)</p> <p>People need not only to obtain things, they need above all the freedom to make things among which they can live, to give shape to them according to their own tastes, and to put them to use in caring for and about others. Prisoners in rich countries often have access to more things and services than members of their families, but they have no say in how things are to be made and cannot decide what to do with them. Their punishment consists in being deprived of what I shall call \u201cconviviality.\u201d They are degraded to the status of mere consumers.

Consequently, educational design and development often involves significant manual gathering and weaving - i.e. the opposite of automating and augmenting. </p> <p>By starting small and continually responding to changes and lessons learned, we automated and augmented educational design and development by figuring out how to digitally gather and weave the relevant strands.

A sense of belonging is key to students\u2019 success and retention in any learning environment. Teaching or teacher presence is significant for setting a climate for belonging. However, few studies have documented how teachers can foster students\u2019 sense of belonging in online settings and students\u2019 experience of these initiatives. This paper presents an exploratory case study of a teacher\u2019s initiatives to foster students\u2019 belonging in an online subject by amplifying teacher presence through technology-mediated, personalised feedback embedded within interactive, engaging subject design. Students\u2019 experiences of the subject and perceptions of their personalised feedback were captured through surveys and focus groups. Together, the findings indicate that the primary role of personalised feedback in fostering belonging was building connectedness between the teacher and students, thereby enhancing students\u2019 motivation to learn in the subject. The findings also resonate with other research highlighting the importance of teacher presence throughout the subject, not just during synchronous classes.</p> <p>Canvas course with interactive design.

However, the challenge of fostering belonging through teacher presence is exacerbated with large cohorts (Stone &amp; Springer, 2019). How can teachers sustain students\u2019 engagement in their learning from week to week, given large enrolments in online courses and the limited time for interaction?\u201d (Lim et al., 2022, p. 2) (pdf)</p> <p>\u201cLearning analytics offers a technological solution to scaling feedback that is personalised to students\u2019 progress and ongoing performance in a course (Pardo et al., 2017).\u201d (Lim et al., 2022, p. 2) (pdf)</p> <p>\u201cOn the other hand, learning analytics feedback interventions that involve humans in the loop are mediated by the teacher and delivered in the teacher\u2019s voice. These systems may therefore be more able to augment teacher presence and foster a sense of belonging in students. One example of a human-in-the-loop learning analytics feedback system is OnTask (Pardo et al., 2018).\u201d (Lim et al., 2022, p. 2) (pdf)</p> <p>\u201cThe intervention involved using OnTask, together with interactive and engaging learning design, to create and communicate regular, personalised messages of feedback and support to all students in a fully online postgraduate subject.\u201d (Lim et al., 2022, p. 2) (pdf)</p> <p>\u201cRegular, personalised feedback was integrated into the learning design through OnTask, a web-based platform that helps teachers create rule-based messages informed by students\u2019 learning data to trigger personalised feedback at scale.\u201d (Lim et al., 2022, p. 3) (pdf)</p> <p>\u201c41 (41% of the cohort) students responded to this survey.

The motivational and relational impact of personalised feedback has been demonstrated in other research (e.g., Lim et al., 2021, Tsai et al., 2021).\u201d (Lim et al., 2022, p. 8) (pdf)</p> <p>\u201cOverall, this case study illustrates that fostering a sense of belonging entails a curriculum-wide approach, an approach that involves a community of students supported by strong teaching presence (Garrison, 2011)\u201d (Lim et al., 2022, p. 8) (pdf)</p> <p>\u201cThis study identifies three possible strategies for fostering belonging in online learning. The first strategy involves leveraging learning analytics to personalise feedback and support and therefore amplify teacher presence in the online learning setting. In this study, tailoring feedback to students\u2019 learning data facilitated \u2018regular and prompt communication between teacher and students\u2019 (Stone &amp; Springer, 2019, p.164), and helped students to feel the teachers\u2019 care and to know that they were valued (Atif et al., 2020). The second strategy is the use of weekly check-in, check-out questions at the start of each synchronous class. For the students taking this subject, these questions played an important role in connecting them to the teacher because they helped the teacher know more about and understand her students not just at the start of the subject but in a dynamic way over the semester. This interactive element created a sense of belonging by building connections between the teacher and students, which fostered student motivation to learn. A third strategy that was enjoyed by students and fostered their belonging in terms of a desire to attend every synchronous class, was the use of collaborative learning activity around \u2018virtual tables\u2019. This strategy involves small group work where students collaborate on in-class activities\u201d (Lim et al., 2022, p. 8) (pdf)</p> <p>\u201cto learn the content. It allowed for thinking time and encouraged students to present and share their work. By giving students advance notice about who would be sharing and presenting in the large group, students were encouraged to participate as part of the learning community\u201d (Lim et al., 2022, p. 9) (pdf)</p>"},{"location":"sense/Conferences/ascilite2022/ascilite2022-day-two.html#scale-up-of-the-artisans-creating-practices-systems--tools-for-a-team-of-learning-designers","title":"Scale-up of the artisans: Creating practices, systems &amp; tools for a team of learning designers","text":"<p>Pecha Kucha presentation</p> <p>Abstract</p> <p>As institutions seek to increase their capacity in various modes and models of instruction, they are relying more heavily on learning designers to implement these projects.

Strong systems work only in narrow and well-defined domains; there will continue to be opportunities to develop intelligent agents in support of learning, more so in the delivery domain (downstream activities) and less so in the planning and analysis phases (upstream activities).  2. Knowledge management systems are by nature weak systems and have a definite place in ID, which is by nature complex and often involves teams and enterprise-level learning and performance issues; some components of a knowledge management system for ID may involve strong and intelligent support, as in an intelligent agent to perform a particular task.  3. The value of knowledge objects and reuse is likely to be realized only when humans are kept involved and systems kept open.  4.

Not forward oriented design. A similar problem with the ABC approach [note on p.121]</p> <p>Indeed, this perception of a creative aspect to design reflects a duality inherent in some conceptions of design. It can be simultaneously the application of'systematic principles and methods' and'a creative activity that cannot be fully reduced to standard steps' (Winograd 1996: xx, xxii)- or, both an art and a science\" [Masterman 2019:122]</p> <p>The overarching practice of design for learning has been operationalized by Dalziel et al.

Observation would seem to suggest this but its not data.</p> <p>If that is true, it doesn't meant that we should change the teaching cycle, or the focus of this type of research. But perhaps it's about explicitly asking teachers (and educational designers) what they are planning and designing when engaged in that activity? Are they taking a more forward oriented approach to design? [note on p.122]</p> <p>In reality, teachers' approach to design is considerably more complex than these two models. For example, different levels of the hierarchy can overlap as a teacher juggles interrelationships, dependencies and multiple actors:\" [Masterman 2019:122]</p> <p>Teachers may also take different routes through the task, some mapping out learning materials while creating the plan while others create all such learning materials afterwards.\" [Masterman 2019:123]</p> <p>Design and planning can never be wholly dissociated from the other stages in Dalziel et al.'s teaching cycle, since a design may need to be adapted in response to contingencies that arise during the learning session itself (engagement with students, or the micro level: Jones, Chapter 4), or reflection may lead to components of the design being added, modified or dropped.\" [Masterman 2019:123]</p> <p>Echoing forward oriented design</p> <p>TODO* Look at the Jones chapter [note on p.123]</p> <p>Successful experimentation with a new technique or technology may lead to its incorporation into one's regular teaching repertoire.\" [Masterman 2019:124]</p> <p>Furthermore, students' demands for technology use can actually militate against innovative teaching practice and, even, propagate conservative pedagogies.\" [Masterman 2019:124]</p> <p>Interviews with lecturers in the Learning Designer project revealed a spectrum of relationships to theory.\" [Masterman 2019:125]</p> <p>Informal communities close to the chalkface were particularly valued by Learning Designer interviewees, largely for the element of trust that comes from close acquaintance.\" [Masterman 2019:128]</p> <p>A number of authors (including Jonassen 2008; Donald et al. 2009) have equated the thought processes involved in designing learning experiences to the solving of problems in ill-defined domains (Lynch et al. 2006)\" [Masterman 2019:129]</p> <p>Such problems lack a single definitive solution, there is no set of steps for the solver to follow that will guarantee success, and the solution chosen depends largely on how the solver conceptualizes the problem. In terms of digital support, this means providing guidance that makes the design'problem' more tractable for the teacher without overly constraining their choices.\" [Masterman 2019:129]</p> <p>Masterman, Walker and Bower (2013) identifyfive approaches that may be adopted in the design of such tools: - - - A general model (ontology) of the domain, on which an expert system can be built to provide guidance to the user. Constraints, which either represent characteristics of a successful solution (patterns and templates) or guide the user towards successful solution of the problem (wizards). A'discovery' approach, where the tool provides a digital environment in which the teacher can model different designs and/or gives guidance on demand.\" [Masterman 2019:129]</p> <p>Case examples, in which the toolfinds, and offers to the user, learning designs created by others to tackle the same pedagogic problem.

This section (or sections) should occupy the major part of the paper. The format is likely to be variable but should include at least the description of the designed artifact and, perhaps, the design search process. 5. Evaluation Evidence that the artifact is useful. The artifact is evaluated to demonstrate its worth with evidence addressing criteria such as validity, utility, quality, and efficacy. 6. Discussion Interpretation of the results: what the results mean and how they relate back to the objectives stated in the Introduction section. Can include: summary of what was learned, comparison with prior work, limitations, theoretical significance, practical significance, and areas requiring further work. Research contributions are highlighted and the broad implications of the paper's results to research and practice are discussed. 7. Conclusions Concluding paragraphs that restate the important findings of the work. Restates the main ideas in the contribution and why they are important."},{"location":"sense/Design/design-science-research.html#evaluation","title":"Evaluation","text":"<p>From Gill &amp; Hevner (2013)</p> Guideline Hevner, et al. [2004, p.83] Description Fitness-Utility Impact Design as an artifact DSR must produce a viable artifact in the form or a construct, a model, a method or an instantiation. Fitness-utility DSR seeks to impact design through enhancing our ability to evaluate the fitness of design artifacts. Problem relevance The objective of DSR is to develop technology-based solutions to important and relevant business problems. The objective of fitness-utility DSR is to improve our ability to estimate the fitness of technology-based artifacts. Design evaluation The utility, quality and efficacy of a design artifact must be rigorously demonstrated via well-executed evaluation methods. The fitness of a design artifact must be estimated using a utility function that involves the full range of characteristics that impact the likelihood that the artifact will replicate and evolve. Research contributions Effective design-science research must provide clear and verifiable contributions in the area of the design artifact, design foundations and/or design methodologies. Effective DSR impacts the design problem space through contributions in the areas of constructing design artifacts, design fitness, design foundations and theories, and/or design methods. Research rigor Design-science research relies upon the application of rigorous methods in both the construction and evaluation of the design artifact. DSR requires that the construction and evaluation of design artifacts be investigated employing a level of rigor appropriate to the nature and stage of design. Design as a search process The search for an effective artifact requires utilizing available means to reach desired ends while satisfying laws in the problem environment. The search for an effective artifact requires utilizing available means to reach desired ends while satisfying laws in the problem environment and constraints imposed by the design fitness landscape. Communication of research Design research must be presented effectively both to technology oriented as well as management oriented audiences. Design research must be communicated to those communities most likely to supply the resources required for future design using communication channels appropriate to each community."},{"location":"sense/Design/design-science-research.html#references","title":"References","text":"<p>Brocke, J. vom, Hevner, A., &amp; Maedche, A.

However, too many courses, not enough design expertise to ensure it's done effectively for all courses. It also means that (most?) education design work involves tinkering around the edges (redesigning assessment tasks, adopting a new tool etc) rather than complete design for learning. design for configuration Post-pandemic sees increasing calls for effective use of technologies for learning. Institutional educational technologies are increasingly complex and yet generic/consistent. Meaning configuration for specific learning contexts is difficult and time consuming. Hence quality often suffers. design for orchestration Increasingly generic tools provide little specific assistance for orchestration. Especially if learning occurs across tools supplied by different vendors. However, the growing importance of retention and the challenges created by generative AI all suggest a much greater need for a focus on the process of learning. Perhaps by implication a much greater need for effective orchestration from teaching staff. design for reflection Ditto design for re-design In order to stretch the iron triangle, institutions are increasingly seeking to re-design courses and their components for different contexts, modes, and purposes.

But much of the institutional and design practice around learning and teaching uses top-down decomposition to break down the complexity of learning and teaching into manageable chunks (Jones and Clark, 2014). Organisationally, expertise in pedagogy is separate from expertise in technology, sometimes curriculum design from learning design and then in the above you can see separation into macro, meso, micro levels, and ACAD's separation between the dimensions of set, epistemic, and social.</p> <p>There is value to this decomposition, however, experience suggests growing need to be able to more effectively cross those boundaries</p> <p>For example, consider the situation where the task is to re-design a course for migration between a synchronous, on-campus mode to an asynchronous online mode. Working on increasing pressure to \"stretch the iron triangle\" this work can't involve a new round of design for learning. Instead, it is more focused on design for re-design. As cheaply as possible, retain the same basic epistemic task, perhaps re-use lessons learned from the on-campus offering, and tinker with the set and social dimensions to retain a similar quality of learning experience. This appears to require a re-weaving of the disparate ACAD dimensions into a different assemblage.</p> <p>While this work can be done at the micro-level, with a specific course.

The first is that the analysis and design of complex learning spaces \u2013 and learning situations more generally \u2013 must pay close attention to students\u2019 activity: what it is they are actually doing. The second is that we need a shared set of actionable concepts that can connect human activity to the physical world (material/digital/hybrid), recognising that activity can be influenced, but is rarely determined, by features of its setting. Without such connecting concepts, it becomes very difficult to design, or to explain the rationale for a new design, or to understand how an existing set of learning arrangements actually works.

new learning spaces in universities and let me say most of my focus is on universities but I hope the message spreads more widely in talking about new learning spaces in higher education we can think about the action that gets taken to create those spaces in a variety of ways but I like this notion of shaping that there's something creative craft like a non-deterministic about it but also there's that double meaning to it that the spaces we shape are also spaces that are meant to shape others and early in the morning to get to recursive but of course one of the things that we're hoping our students will learn to do through their experiences in the learning spaces that we create is learn to shape their own spaces </p> <p>It's probably a neglected aspect of becoming a lifelong learner or engaging in lifetime inquiry that pulling together the tools resources and people that you need in order to do that is part of the deal so some of their activities ideally should help them learn to

back to that right at the end now when I get asked what I do for a living these days one of the things that I say it makes a little bit of sense to me as I engage in design research which is that I'm interested in design knowledge which i think of as being actionable knowledge for design practice so in our field that's designed for learning educational design instructional design call it what you will but I'm interested in the many forms of knowledge that make design possible and easier more efficient more effective design research I see as an intellectual enterprise and a practical enterprise that doesn't just create design knowledge but finds curate's it and so on and so forth and it feels to me that that conception of an intellectual academic activity that's intimately connected to design and suppress or to sit somewhere near the heartland of learning technology and its work both in the world of learning and teaching and also in the world of research again we might come back to

more general and shareable it's problematic it's difficult.</p> <p>I want to talk about now a little bit also and there are a number of reasons for this but I think one of the corollaries of that difficulty of articulating the deep knowledge that we've got about how to improve learning environments one of the things that flows from that is that public discourse and I think I'd include a lot of high level organizational discourse fails to reflect the subtleties of that and some of how learning technology spaces and so on get talked about in the broad discussion this brought public discussions about higher education I think is the weaker and actually the more damaging because of that lack</p> <p>So that's part of my framing I want to focus particularly on design knowledge to say

set of spaces and that when we're thinking about learning when we're thinking about what can be done in education when they're critiquing education or reading insightful critiques of current practice

auditioning of hand positioning of body in relation to the patient and so on and it's I believe at the time it was built anyway it was the largest dancing simulation lab in the world it's a sizeable thing substantial investment </p> <p>you're not working as well as they wanted it to for a variety of reasons and so not be spending time hanging out in this space observing closely how the students and instructors are doing what they're doing and coming forward with some recommendations about incremental improvements to the design there and like many of these spaces it's got to be organized in a way that both allows a lot of individual work but also can be switched over to group mode when an instructor needs to do a demonstration and also instructors need to be able to move around between the work stations in order to do some human supervision to to complement what's happening through the automated supervision system

Sciences faculty at Sydney and she's developed a gaming environment that is meant to support medical students in revising their knowledge of human anatomy she's done that in a way and there are two special aspects to this really she's done that in a way that uses spatial metaphor for both the knowledge and the competition that's involved in this game so two groups of Anatomy students compete in real time against each other over a period of an hour or two they do this by answering questions about the draw on their anatomical knowledge each time they answer a question they gain control of a piece of territory and deny control to the opposition so that game aside element is meant to give them a bit of extra motivation to do revision in order to do well in this competition.</p> <p>but the other special element is then okay and this came as a bit of an afterthought for Anna hellbender we organized the students themselves in the bottom image we see four students in a team playing this game they're playing against another team who are in a separate room and these four students are organized in a way that makes it possible for them to share answers to questions knowledge and also engage in tactical decision making as part of strategizing in the game and they can do that in a way where they're not over by the rifle team and that turns that out to have I think as soon as I say

14","text":"<p>but it can sometimes be hard to think through exactly how these spatial arrangements are going to need to work now of course LT has a seek on new learning spaces and I think that means I don't have to make a song and dance of the argument why on earth is it we're talking about learning spaces are learning tech conference and I think there are a number of approaches to this but I'll keep it short because I suspect that many people are convinced by the argument but it seems to me within learning Tech over the years if certainly if I go back over the period I've been working in it we've not always paid a lot of attention to the physical setting within which digital tools are being used we've been very focused in on digital worlds and digital environments</p> <p>I think quite often we've missed a lot about student experience of learning by having that slightly blinkered view so I'd want to make the claim that we can very rarely do a good job of designing managing or evaluating physical learning spaces these days without some reference to digital technology or to understanding digital technologies without referring to sites of use and I want to just go a bit further and say if we accept that then I think we have to recognize that within the learning tech community is a capability that's actually much needed within higher education at least as I discern it through conversations with people who are working on new learning spaces and </p> <p>it's pretty much like this that within our field we have some ideas that can be used to connect valued learning activities things that we want students to be doing to the physical digital material to reason about those relationships think about them when we are needing to participate in design and evaluation and that that kind of knowledge those modes of thinking and not yet widespread amongst architects campus infrastructure planners and managers and so on so there's a real contribution for us to be making there and I suspect many of you are being called upon in order to to do that and it seems to me a very right and proper thing to be doing and from our expertise space there's more expansive notion of what learning technology is about I think that if we if we follow Bill Mitchell and say well you know the modern world is is one in which the digital and material are interpenetrating each other in ever accelerating ways such that it becomes more and more problematic to separate the two if we think about ideas on digital materiality x' unadapted sensory environments and so on </p> <p>if we think about some of that literature and ideas some of which we've seen coming throughout the conference this time around about understanding learning as taking place within complex networks of people ideas tools resources and so on and if also we give some credence to notions about the extended mind and distributed cognition and begin to think a lot of cognition leaks out of the skull out of the brain box if we need to understand how people are doing complex things we need to give due account to relationships with other people to share problem-solving and so on all of those I think are conjuring up an intellectual landscape that is encouraging us to think more broadly about the fundamental enterprise of learning technology </p>"},{"location":"sense/Design/goodyear-shaping-spaces.html#slide-16","title":"Slide 16","text":"<p>so I now want to focus in on the nature of design knowledge and talk a bit about some of our work that's come out of the last few years researcher Sydney that my colleagues and I have been doing and I've been running quite a bit about the nature of design and design knowledge within educational technology there's a few papers you can download that are open access on that but what we've been doing I think needs to be understood as a mixture of both empirical research and normative work by which I mean that we've been doing studies of how people design for other people's learning in the educational design research that you do and in many other places in looking at how that actually gets done because that gives you a reality check you can then think as you develop new normative models suggesting here's how you might go about design here are some ways of thinking about design problems you can then say okay well how do we need to formulate that knowledge so it fits with what we know about design practice so what I'm going to say over the next few minutes emerges from both empirical work and that kind of normative conceptual development</p> <p>a point to make right here is that those I think rather complex learning spaces that we were looking at with their hybridity of the digital and material with the complex activities that are going on within them in a way it is a remarkable achievement there that people who were designing those spaces were for sure tackling very complex problems they didn't find them easy but they did it they were able to do it and for me this is a bit like they'll think about bumblebees can't fly no they can fly in practice but they can't fly in theory</p>"},{"location":"sense/Design/goodyear-shaping-spaces.html#slide-17","title":"Slide 17","text":"<p>because if you look at normative models of instructional design educational design they would really struggle to equip you to design what goes on in those spaces materially socially and otherwise so people in doing that work actually fall back on a number of heuristics often unconscious or tacit that actually enable them to get the job done and you know as I say this we probably all recognise it as something we do but it's not properly reflected I think in the literature about how to do design for learning one thing they do is and they may not talk about this a lot </p> <p>but they take learner activity as foundational that's where the imagination is it's always what are these students going to be doing physically mentally emotionally socially and so on that's there all the time and that is really helpful so the focus is not on what the teacher is going to be doing it's not on content of syllabus coverage it's what are the students actually going to be doing in these spaces and then how do we organize the tools the infrastructure the spatial configuration of things around them so that in those imagined activities that we the things they need come to hand at the moment they need them so that the activity unfolds smoothly and </p> <p>that really is the essence of it so I now want to say a few things very quickly about design knowledge and thinking about some of the relationships between what can be designed and the valued activities that we want our students to engage in and I think it's important to say first this can never be a deterministic form of reasoning and this is one of those points about how the difficulty we have articulating some of these ideas bleeds into the poverty of discourse generally about such things as the likely effects of new learning spaces because that discourse is often rather deterministic </p> <p>the assumption is we'll create this new space and students were behaving this way I also want to say that in thinking about design and thinking about the relationships between what can be designed and what students then do I think we need to push ourselves to actually understand the reality of what happens at learn time now I've not got enough time to really make this point properly so I'll make it in properly and you can come back at me if you want to but it seems to me too often in our practice in educational technology in education more generally </p>"},{"location":"sense/Design/goodyear-shaping-spaces.html#slide-2020","title":"Slide 2020","text":"<p>we rely on correlational studies we say there's this thing we're interested in these these things that may correlate with that if we find some statistical relationship okay that's that's a publishable story or that forms knowledge that ought to be useful for subsequent design or education work and pretty often I think what correlational studies will do at best is alert you to something that might be interesting but they very rarely come anywhere near explaining what actually happens because very often they depend upon abstract theoretical notions that are not realized </p> <p>if you want to get me started one of those would be engagement all right it's a term that hides a multitude of actual activities and relationships so I want to say and this may seem ontologically naive I want to say we need to understand how things actually work we need to get close to the action and understand how they actually work this study about professors banning laptops is another case in point this is a study out of West Point College in their academy in the States and if you read the paper on which this is based the study looked at correlations between whether or not students had their laptops in lectures and their end of course grade okay nothing about what they were doing with the laptops nothing that distinguished students who were looking at Facebook from students who were making copious notes that they would use for a revision later on ignoring the activity that is the

the core of the message that I keep banging on about is that what students actually do is what matters in a way it's the only thing that matters it's the only thing that's real it's the only thing that has an effect upon their learning it's the only thing but it's not design about all right unless we're in those very rare situations in which we can grab students by the shoulder and smack them around the head or more seriously if we're in high-risk high-cost trading areas you might think of some areas of surgery or training pilots whatever it might be less we're in those kind of areas typically we want students to exercise agency to customize learning environments and tasks to suit them better there will be a gap between what</p> <p>we asked them to do and what they actually do but it's what they actually do that affect what they learn what we can do from a design standpoint is create what you might call structuring resources that include tools that come to hand as students are engaging in valuable activities but also which guide them okay so and just to make this point clearer I want to say that for most students the vast majority of the activities they engage in in which through which they learn are not well supervised they're either not supervised at all or they're likely or theories who provides depart ly because of staff student ratios resources so a lot of what they do has to make sense to them as they're doing it without much external moment-by-moment guidance we know that when students are engaging in active learning they've got to be focused on that which they're supposed to be learning what they're supposed to be getting out of this but a whole bunch of other task management stuff what do I do next</p> <p>am I supposed to work with this person is that idea good is this going to be up to speed with this am i moving quickly often so in active learning which we value very highly there dangers of cognitive overload or just getting lost in the mechanics of the task and so part of the point of designing things that are in the environment at learn time configured in spaces material or virtual is to help structure that activities to take off some of that cognitive load so that it can be focused where it should be </p> <p>the salt saw about web design don't make me think yeah now design for me is not about that it's saying help me think about the central matters but don't make me think about all the stuff that I need in order to navigate my way to the place the situation or the point in the task where I can really focus my thinking on what I need to learn are you doing your dance yet or are we still a couple of minutes off we're 12 minutes off you sure which well minutes off from when I should shut up this is not an acceptable substitute for a dance</p>"},{"location":"sense/Design/goodyear-shaping-spaces.html#slide-23","title":"Slide 23","text":"<p>you're on we had some disco lights running earlier so now apologies for this slide sorry I did take a look at this from the back of the hole earlier and I'll have to talk you through it unless you've got a copy of it in front of you and it features in quite a bit of the writing that Pepe yeomen vasila Carvalho and myself do around a camp the activity centers analysis and design framework so you can look at it more closely there but I'm just going to pick out a couple of main points from it </p> <p>what its centered learner activity centered analysis and design so the focus needs to be on learner activity what they are actually doing it happens at and often in higher education we want students to be creative in their customization of the tasks that we set them it's a situated activity so the social situation and the physical situation material and digital image the activities set those are consequential alright the tools that come to hand have effects upon the nature of the activity as often as not most of the point if the right tools the right resources are not there at the time the activity unfolds it's unlikely to be very successful I'm going to temporize that notified out a little bit </p> <p>to get away from the deterministic language but I hope you know what I mean so we can't design the activity but we can design we can do set design we can design the physical the material the digital tools artifacts spaces and so on within which activity unfolds and we can do some social design work that is we can do things like make recommendations about working together</p> <p>in pairs or in groups of five or you know think of yourselves as a learning community what actually unfolds may well be different from that as we all know with studies of how students actually do group work rolling on how we recommend they do group work but the point is design needs to focus on those kinds of structuring resources key among them being tasks suggestions we may have good things to do that become resources for activities that students then engage in and one of the key distinctions I want to make is between that notion of tasks what we are students to do and activity what they actually do the tasks not being something that determines what they do but a resource that they use in shaping what they do so when we think about design knowledge </p>"},{"location":"sense/Design/goodyear-shaping-spaces.html#slide-24","title":"Slide 24","text":"<p>we're thinking about something sets of actionable concepts that help with reasoning about relationships and I'm going to focus on relationships between humans and things so if you think about it when we're engaged in what we call set design you're thinking about the way physical digital other resources fit together you're thinking about relationships between things and other things it's the sort of thinking that engineers do quite commonly </p> <p>when you're thinking about relationships between people and how they collaborate human human relationships all sorts of other ideas come into play about intentionality and emotion and so on but I want to focus in on the HT relationships the relationships between people and things where things is understood as that whole cornucopia of physical material all digital configured spatially so HT and what I want to say at this point is that I think those relationships between students in activity and the things the tools and resources and environment that they need in order to make a success of that activity relationships are essentially economic relationships they're just like the relationships that people study in workplaces when they're configuring workplaces and workflow and and so on they are not essentially pedagogical relationships and </p> <p>I think this is a bit of a heretic or point within education and learning technology more specifically it seems to me that pedagogy has a role to play in thinking about relationships between desirable learning outcomes and tasks and activities thinking through what it is we might get students to do why they might be regarded as valuable practices and so on but the notion that relationships between a laptop a piece of software or virtual learning environment and the activity of the students engaging in the notion that that's essentially a pedagogical relationship </p> <p>I think really Beth scrutiny and I think there's an important point for us because I think some of those arguments that are essentially economic arguments are easier to make in conversations with architects and builders campus infrastructure people as soon as you say what students are gonna be doing this kind of work and for that they need these kinds of tools and resources and they needed space that allows them to do that that's understandable if you start wrapping it up in wooly stuff about pedagogy that they know they've got no background in it is much harder to get them to take the argument seriously and you will find those kinds of things slip out of building developments over time they don't have traction in the way that economic argument subtraction now we are running tight on time I just want to very briefly talk about a couple of ideas on connecting concepts so these are the HT relationships that I was talking about a moment ago on that slide </p> <p>so if you think about how do we do design work how do we think about relationships between what somebody's going to be doing what students are going to be doing when they're engaging in a task an activity that flows from that task the relationships between that and the physical material digital resources configured in space around them how do we think about that what kind of ideas allow us to make deductions about what's needed and within the literature of learning technology about the only idea that ever comes up is affordance </p> <p>yeah you with me do you agree you're stunned so Martin Oliver who whose work have got a great deal of respect for has analyzed the use of the term affordance within the learning tackle it returned and came to this conclusion a few years ago that the concept has drifted so far from its origins that is now too ambiguous to be unwittingly useful what else have we got what other ideas do we have in our toolkit if you like that allow us to connect things that are designed through to activity </p> <p>Howie Collins coming from another area sociology of science retton's that affordances are lazy term your papers over the cracks for him he thinks the reason it's not such useful term is that people have an extraordinary interpretive capability that we're not going to just look at something and say oh it must be used for such-and-such because we can think about how we might use that thing how we might relate to it and so on and </p> <p>Lucilla Carvalho and I did a bit of work on this not so long ago drawing on down Carmen's ideas about fast and slow thinking that if you think about again I'm packing too much in too few words but you think about your brain working in two moments fast and slow system one system too as he called it but a lot of what we do happens automatically virtually automatically little voluntary control and so on and every now and then we run into a problem we stop and think okay I had no idea what going on here I bet I think about this more more carefully but system 2 is expensive yeah we can't do everything using system 2 so we only call it up or it only get called up when it's needed and so one of the ways you can rescue affordance as a term is by saying actually it operates in that system one space it operates automatically semi-automatics me and it takes very little ads very difficult of loads to the doing of the tasks </p> <p>if you can help a student move their activity in a certain kind of way through affordance that's great because you're not going to add much to their burden every now and then something happens where they have to really think through what's going on what do I do next how do i navigate this space sound do I find the next thing to do in this task that's going to be high cognitive load but that might be just the thing you want them to be focused on at that point </p> <p>so I think we can rescue affordance I can I think we can find a slot for it I think there's a more general version of this notion and people have done a bit of work on structuration we didn't learn in technology to try and again get a bit of a grip on these relationships between what can be designed the physical world digital spaces and so on and what people then do knowing that structures what exists in the world can be influential but there is also human agency and often in education we want that agency to grow stronger rather than weaker over time </p> <p>so a way of thinking about relationships between structures that are desirable and agency that we want to see exercised and grow stronger is in these terms comes from Mary archers were more broadly but we can think of there being such things as structures that are objective and out there in the world that both constrain and enable various kinds of activity and there's agency which is personal subjective</p> <p>but he's also crucial for those structures to have any kind of effect yeah so it's only if I know how to interpret such and such or how to do such and such that thing can have an effect upon what I do so there's if you like a two-way relationship between structure and agency but I don't think he's often surfaced in when these ideas education and and educational technology and you can broaden that out and and think with structures we're not just talking about spatial structures and their influence upon us all material structures and their influence upon us but activity is actually unfolding in multi dimensional landscapes child escapes and so on and the agency works out in different ways within those complex spaces so there's a point which I think will have occurred to a lot of you that my examples at the beginning were not representative of work across the whole of higher education </p> <p>they come mainly from stem and I picked them partly because they make visible some aspects of student activity and if the resources the students are drawing on and how those are configured in in material spaces but I think I also want to make the claim that although the practices and some of the supportive tools are less visible in other areas of academic work they are there or should be there and are just as necessary so these approaches that are essentially apprentice based or approaches to learning that are about participation in valuing practices that I exemplified early on in laboratories in CT scanning operations and so on they play through into history sociology business studies in other kinds of areas that we know there are very powerful pedagogical arguments behind thinking about learning as learning to parties in value social practices so the theme then becomes well how do we think about the right sets of cognitive tools and other kinds of tools that enable that activity when it's situated real time physical material digital space and so on and </p> <p>I think the last point I want to make and this connects in a subtle sort of way with some of the things that Donnie and Jean was saying on earlier days is that in doing this I think our work is much more powerful and we can enable higher education to be much more powerful if we think about that apprenticeship for our students as at least including things like learning to enquire learning to do the core of academic work learning to require learning to design inquiry in new spaces that don't have established methods for creating knowledge learning to use knowledge and learning to work with others in order to do good in the world</p> <p>in order to make changes in the world it seems to me we need to make those connections to some of the core and distinctive purposes of higher education if we're going to stand any chance of joining up that micro level work that we do remember my the lowest space on that diagram if we're going to connect that up to the broader purposes of higher education to the role that universities can play in a very troubled world then we need to be able to think about apprenticeships in these kinds of consequential knowledge where and I think that's about it I think if I had some closing points there'd be these and things to take away </p> <p>that design I think can be well understood as being about reasoning relation between reasoning about relationships between valued outcomes valued activities and mix complex mix often if tasks - or spaces divisions of labor required to structure and scaffold task completion and the growth of agency central point here knowing what our students are actually doing and learning is core is fundamental is expensive is difficult often involves intrusive work but if our knowledge of what they're actually doing and learning is flaky insubstantial we can have very little confidence in the nature of the enterprise we can we can have very little confidence that what we're doing is good and I don't think that the data that you get from keystroke trails actually tells you much about what students are really doing thinking feeling and so on and </p> <p>I haven't said much about epistemic fluency there's more in the notes and I've written more about it elsewhere but the point here really is that design knowledge has to be seen as something that is heterogeneous in form it gets created in all sorts of ways through practice through study through theorization and so on it operates well in some spaces and not surveilling others and being able to recognize what kinds of knowledge are most likely to be useful in what kinds of space I think that capability is fundamental both to the success of our students but also to the success of our own work as educators and designers knowing how knowledge works where it works best is fundamental capability and that's it I'm going to stop there I want to do a little bit of

However, the iron triangle literature in higher education (Daniel et al, 2009; Mulder, 2013; Ryan et al, 2021) suggests that maximising all three is difficult, if not impossible. The iron triangle suggests that changes in one quality will negatively impact one or more of the other qualities. For example, increasing accessibility quickly as part of an emergency response to a pandemic required significant additional cost to staff and resulted in a perceived reduction in the quality of learning experiences (Martin, 2020). The iron triangle literature identifies particular strategies that promise to break the iron triangle, including: open and distance eLearning (Daniel et al., 2009); open educational resources (Mulder, 2013); and, high-quality large group pedagogies, alternative curriculum structures, and automation of assessment and feedback (Ryan et al., 2021). </p> <p>While these strategies differ in intent their implementation almost inevitably draws on the same strategic, planning-by-objectives approaches. Approaches that leverage practices such as stepwise refinement and loose coupling to decompose difficult problems into smaller, more tractable problems before re-assembling like Lego blocks the disparate, smaller solutions to achieve the larger goal. From a distributive or socio-material perspective the na\u00efve atomistic assumptions underpinning such practices are inherently problematic (Dron, 2022; Fawns, 2022; Jones &amp; Clark, 2014). For example, almost two decades ago Parrish (2004) argued that effective use of learning objects \u2013 the ultimate decontextualised pedagogical Lego blocks \u2013 is impossible without significant additional effort at appropriate re-contextualisation. </p> <p>This poster explores how this re-contextualisation challenge plagues all institutional attempts to break the iron triangle by examining a Learning Management System (LMS) migration. An LMS migration is an effective exploratory case since it is one of the most labour-intensive and complex projects undertaken by universities (Cottam, 2021). The poster illustrates how three common enterprise Lego blocks used in LMS migration are explicitly designed to disentangle objects from context specific knowledge and design intent and thus require significant manual re-entanglement to produce effective outcomes. The poster demonstrates how an alternate approach of integrating the common Lego blocks into assemblages of contextually aware educational technologies helps people more effectively and efficiently orchestrate the necessary re-entanglement and provides a foundation for on-going improvement and innovation. </p> <p>Approaches like this are used outside universities for innovation and service development (Bygstad, 2017) and increasingly actively supported at an enterprise level within universities for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of administrative processes (Duncan &amp; Lundy, 2019). However, as in this case, application of such approaches to university learning and teaching are limited to small, ad hoc pockets of innovation and not widely recognised or supported institutionally. Experience from this case suggests that while Universities fail to effectively deal with the re-contextualisation challenge, they will struggle to break the iron triangle.</p> <p>Keywords: iron triangle, entangled pedagogy, LMS migration</p> <p>References </p> <p>Bygstad, B.

This claim, they say, does not come at the expense of the personal but seeks to treat the material and the human symmetrically in order to explain how entities, knowledge, other actors and relations of mediation and activity converge in learning....What becomes clear, through the lens of a sociomaterial approach, is that increased connectivity and participation in networked structures gives rise to an increased dependence, which drives the need to understand the relations between constituent parts. (p. 1134)</p> <p>Core to understanding of this is Hodder's (2012) theory of entanglement. Which offers a reasonable way of structuring the cases but with additional consideration to the evolmenet.

LTI stuck at the middle level and unable to work at scale, relying on manual work)</p> <p>As a consequence, the dualisms of agency and structure, human and non-human, knowledge and power, before and after, material and social are no longer taken as given or fixed, but as the effects or outcomes of assemblages. (p. 1128) this is perhaps important summary of the difference - the preceding brings up work from archeology, actor-network theory</p> <p>Moreover, having untangled our small bit of the world, we should always remember the intention is not to pull things apart but to \u2018explore entanglement itself, engaging in thick, rich, contextual analysis\u2019 (Hodder, 2012, p. 218).</p> <p>That is, many of these relational approaches to materiality work within a shallow or use-value notion of ecological or systems thinking. Rather than networks or meshworks, Hodder (2012) proposes a dialectical tension between enabling dependence and constraining dependency, resulting in what he calls sticky entrapment\u2014a state in which choices, once made, limit the range of subsequent opportunities for future action. (p. 1128) this resontates eith the generative thign?</p> <p>What is more, deterministic accounts of tools and spaces for learning tend to focus on identifying generic and decontextualised properties of tools or spaces, without considering the qualities of the objects themselves, and how these, in turn, may influence people, their values and purposeful action. (p. 1121)</p> <p>we argue that those involved in educational design (e.g. teachers, space planners, architects, instructional designers) need analytical tools capable of increasing the correspondence between (a) pedagogy, place and people and (b) theory, design and practice. (p. 1121) this being a nod toward, but not quite the same as the need for educational designers to have CARs to reveal what is embedded within a course site.  Becuese we don't have the analytical tools the authors discuss</p> <p>First, our work is deeply rooted in material accounts of situated learning activity, which means we are not satisfied by descriptions of learning in which the role of materials is either absent or overly deterministic. (p. 1121)</p> <p>That is, our focus is on the learning whole (people, place and pedagogy) and our aim is to support the analysis and design of complex networked learning environments. (p. 1122) which is also the aim of migration, courses are not black boxes to easily move, they are complex entangled environments)</p> <p>Our intention is to support correspondence between dimensions of design (left to right) and scale levels (top to bottom). (p. 1127) perhaps the project (and LMS and SCORM and LTI) fails to effective go from top to bottom, the atomistic tends to stick at the middle layer and fails to effectively represent and detail with the complexity of the lower/micro level.  Does my case illustrate that difficulty? Perhaps this is part of the problem with loose coupling, it assumes you don't need to know the detail or the entanglement</p> <p>They use Alexander's definitions of Macro, Meso, and Micro to identify differrent types of scale i.e. - Macro - region - \"broad context for the design and are built through cumulative acts of a community over time\" - Meso - shape - \"the shape or structure of things, or groups of things, and the spaces between them\" - Micro - detail - \"the details for Level II patterns and can be built in a single act by an invididual\"</p> <p>Does that then become - Macro - the insttitutional context, the VLE, LMS, CMS etc - Meso - course profile, learning outcomes - Micro - learning activities.</p> <p> </p> <p>However, reaching consensus about a shared epistemology of learning in these diverse teams is the crucial first step, and failing to do so often results in dissonance across scale levels and/or dimensions of design. A common example of this type of dissonance arises when, instead of clearly articulating epistemologies of learning upfront, project user groups start with aspirational visions of newness (macro-epistemic) that drive design briefs for innovative buildings and technology (macro-set) which, if enacted in the presence of hierarchical organisational forms (macro-social), can result in aesthetically pleasing environments that speak of newness but fail to give rise to the desired quality of learning activity. That is, when working towards coherence, everything is on the table, and a desire for collaboration and a need for compliance are often at the heart of dissonance. We argue that this challenge can be addressed through an exploration of the material properties of the designed environment and the quality of learning activity they support.</p>"},{"location":"sense/Design/role-of-relationships-breaking-the-iron-triangle.html#dron-and-educational-technology","title":"Dron and educational technology","text":"<p>Tweet</p> <p>Economic, organizational, and political technology is also part of ed tech, as much as the pedagogical and the digital, and it both influences and is reinforced by its parts.

They show that learning is not a commodity that can be mobilised or transferred from one setting to another, since new situations always require new learning, and the adaptation and re-contextualisation of previous knowledge (Hager and Hodkinson 2009).</p> <p>Touching on the atomistic/individualistic approaches the linkage here is that these perspective not just underpin ideas around learning, but also around how organisational work should be done -- a particular knowledge regime...setting up the idea of lightweight IT as a different knowledge regime and its connection with what's required...Fawns et al (2021, p. 363)</p> <p>Our analysis was underpinned by practice theory and sociomaterial perspectives, outlined in the Introduction, enabling understanding emergent forms of learning in complex, fluid settings, within which possible actions are shaped and constrained (Schatzki, Knorr-Cetina, and Von Savigny 2001; Fenwick, Edwards, and Sawchuck 2011). These perspectives trouble the individualist, cognitivist standpoints that have dominated educational approaches (Mulcahy 2014), instead encompassing the collective and relational practices through which professionals enact learning (Fenwick 2014). This orientation helped us to understand the ongoing negotiation and reconciliation of multiple contexts, and forms of academic and practical knowledge, as participants navigated complex environments.</p> <p>And definitely echoing the simple/complex and predictable/emergent challenge with IT...Fawns et al (2021, p. 370)</p> <p>Yet Gough (2013, 1223) warns that constructively aligned curricula will be based on notions of an \u2018isolated simple system\u2019. In consequence, what is learned is measured in terms of expected behaviour, rather than in relation to the emergent practices required of unpredictable and complex situations.... We suggest that routinised disciplinary knowledge (e.g. competencies) is still a crucial aspect of academic professional education, and should contribute to professional accountability. Rather than accepting competencies as guarantees of safe or successful performance in complex practice, however, they might be understood as a necessary basis from which learners must diverge, in ways that are attuned to their varied practice contexts. Accountability, in other words, should encompass the contextualised adaptation of routinised knowledge.</p>"},{"location":"sense/Design/role-of-relationships-breaking-the-iron-triangle.html#focus-on-seams","title":"Focus on Seams","text":"<p>Fawns et al (2021, p. 363)</p> <p>we borrowed Vertesi\u2019s (2014) metaphor of seams to represent the messy, often hidden or unarticulated ways of patching together multiple infrastructures and systems. Vertesi (2014) developed her conception of seams from the work of computing design theorists Chalmers and Galani (2004), who proposed that, rather than aiming for seamlessness, in which the different working elements of a system are made invisible (Ratto 2007), exposing the seams between elements could encourage examinations of interdependence, and of ongoing processes of appropriation to suit particular situations. Literature on professional practice and education from sociomaterial and practice theory perspectives (e.g. Fenwick, Edwards, and Sawchuck 2011; Rooney et al. 2015) helped us to relocate Vertesi\u2019s work from a remote context (a space station) to the professional education contexts of our participants.... For us, seams imply a less stable and clear-cut interface than boundaries. They are contingent on the work of people, in conjunction with materials and devices, to align and make sense of multiple contexts (Vertesi 2014). Accordingly, we came to consider the negotiation of academic and professional contexts as \u2018less a question of boundary work as\u2026a kind of ad hoc patchwork\u2019 (269). However, as Vertesi observed, people still use seams to construct temporary boundaries via various exclusions and inclusions, achieved through technological and social means. This produces sub-spaces of localised and constrained activity (Vertesi 2014, 276).</p> <p>Link to bricolage Fawns et al (2021, p. 371)</p> <p>In using seamfulness as an analytic concept, Vertesi (2014) recommended thinking through the constraints of infrastructures, while observing how people, rather than producing stable and coherent systems, craft \u2018fleeting moments of alignment suited to particular tasks with materials ready-to-hand\u2019 (268).</p> <p>And a possible link to Dron's view of educational technology </p> <p>On the other hand, Vertesi suggested that failures to knot systems together successfully can illuminate the otherwise obscured infrastructural elements and relations essential to the task at hand. Jane\u2019s lack of a \u2018chair to sit on\u2019 or an accessible computer constitute more than a problem to be solved by finding resources. These challenges are entangled in the wider infrastructural provision of space and resources, social hierarchies, the preparation of professionals and the working environment for the incorporation of new, junior colleagues</p>"},{"location":"sense/Design/role-of-relationships-breaking-the-iron-triangle.html#good-teaching-as-subversion-of-the-system---perhaps-in-the-discussion","title":"Good teaching as subversion of the system - perhaps in the discussion","text":"<p>Fawns tweet about education \"an ever-increasingly bureaucratic system of fixes to other fixes (each intervention or change is a response to a problem caused by a previous change)\" and subsequent discussion.

Where competence is a clearly-bound, individualised, prescriptive and demonstrable accomplishment of a performance standard, adaptive capacity is an always-developing potential to integrate into, and shape, teams, systems and settings. It is distinguished from notions of adaptive expertise (e.g. Hatano and Inagak 1986) by its emphasis on collective and relational practice. In adaptive capacity, relational agency is prioritised over performances. It is what allows learners to negotiate new sociomaterial situations, by being accomplished not only in predictable, regular patterns of practice but also in developing emergent practices as required</p>"},{"location":"sense/Design/role-of-relationships-breaking-the-iron-triangle.html#case-studies","title":"Case studies","text":"<p>Actual assemblage development - CARs and echo360 embed mapping - from Blackboard - word2Canvas - to Canvas - canvas-collections - in Canvas</p> <p>Theoretical/conceptual - I'm not a technology person - Consistency, confusion and constraint - Perspectives on design: big-up front, forward-oriented and design-in-use - Mindsets aka the light-weight development name for this</p>"},{"location":"sense/Design/role-of-relationships-breaking-the-iron-triangle.html#what-is-in-a-course-site-cars","title":"What is in a course site?

Once adopted, technologies can seek to enhance and extend teachers' design practice.\" (Bennett et al 2017:126)</p> <p>This research highlights the key role teachers have in influencing student outcomes through their design of learning experiences.\" (Bennett et al 2017:127)</p> <p>*The provision of a tools and an institutional ecosystem that values, enables and supports teacher engagement and reflection with teaching as design for learning would arguably provide better contextual factors encouraging better practice.</p> <p>Especially if it were done in a convivial way in which all those involved were able to contribute (more on convival coudl fit here) (note on p.127)*</p> <p>unit design is often an individual responsibility, even in environments where there is collegial planning at a program level (Bennett et al. 2011)\" (Bennett et al 2017:127)</p> <p>All three studies provided insights into how colleagues are a source of ideas through informal discussions\" (Bennett et al 2017:127)</p> <p>Raising questions about how this can be supported and encouraged in any type of system.

These factors influence the teaching experience facilitated by the teacher and experienced by the student, and lead to the outcomes for both learner and teacher.\" (Bennett et al 2017:128)</p> <p>The conceptual framing highlights teaching (and therefore teacher design) as a complex, situated practice.\" (Bennett et al 2017:129)</p> <p>These changes have brought significant pressure on educators to adopt new and innovative educational approaches within a relatively short time. Designsupport services exist centrally or within the faculties of all Australian universities, but these are limited resources for which there is strong demand, leaving many university teachers to rely on their own skills\" (Bennett et al 2017:133)</p> <p>Two distinct starting points emerged from descriptions of designing a new unit, while the starting points for redesigning were more varied.\" (Bennett et al 2017:133)</p> <p>The situation was quite different when redesigning an existing unit.\" (Bennett et al 2017:134)</p> <p>This is more what we do. There has been some identified need to do a redesign. Which is different from going back to first principles. The difference typically comes with a different purpose. (note on p.134)</p> <p>Overall, five key reasons surfaced for redesigning: addressing feedback from students and colleagues (12 participants); updating the content covered in a unit (10 participants); making changes to perceived problems identified during teaching the unit (8 participants); changing the way a unit is delivered to include online components (6 participants); and staff changes such as taking over from someone who had left (4 participants).\" (Bennett et al 2017:134)</p> <p>The accounts provided by our participants suggest that design and redesign processes begin differently. When designing a new unit, participants began by focusing on either learning outcomes or content area, whereas when redesigning an existing unit, the starting point depended on the specific modifications required.\" (Bennett et al 2017:135)</p> <p>Participants explained that in the early stages of the design process they needed to create or understand the unit's overarching framework.\" (Bennett et al 2017:135)</p> <p>*Pointing to the value provided by the ABC Learning Design type overview. But perhaps also raising questions about how well existing practice provides this over-arching framework at the start?</p> <p>Is part of the problem with L&amp;T that all we have typically is a list of topics, lecture slides, tute sheets and assessment tasks? (note on p.135)*</p> <p>Only when this framework was established did they turn their attention to the specifics of the unit\" (Bennett et al 2017:135)</p> <p>After the overarching unit framework had been established, attention turned to designing the specifics of the unit, such as selecting readings, creating content resources, developing specific learning activities to include in classes, and determining the timing and requirements of assessment tasks.\" (Bennett et al 2017:136)</p> <p>Working iteratively was important for achieving this alignment, but the processes described did not involve a systematic or linear sequence.\" (Bennett et al 2017:136)</p> <p>Instead, participants typically described working on whatever aspects of the design they deemed to be a priority at the time, while also checking new details against what they had already specified\" (Bennett et al 2017:136)</p> <p>When participants had not taught the unit before, they undertook a process of familiarization to better understand the existing unit's structure and determine whether its existing design aligned with their teaching style and content expertise.\" (Bennett et al 2017:136)</p> <p>*Raising interesting points about how this works in the increasingly non-traditional/casualised approach to teaching.</p> <p>e.g. the distinction between a permanent member of staff who serves as the nominal course convenor, but doesn't teach at all. Instead, that's a task taken on by one or more casuals. (note on p.137)*</p> <p>When participants redesigned an existing unit that they had taught before, their redesign considerations mainly focused on the specific aspects of the unit they wanted to modify or improve, such as updating the scope of content, making modifications to address student feedback, making changes to issues identified during implementation, and making changes to how the unit would be delivered, such as incorporating online components\" (Bennett et al 2017:137)</p> <p>articipants explained this as a process of trying to achieve alignment among the outcomes, content, activities, and assessment, supported by their overall framework and driven by a desire to improve the unit's design.\" (Bennett et al 2017:137)</p> <p>For our participants, design was an iterative process that occurs before, during, and after a unit's implementation.\" (Bennett et al 2017:137)</p> <p>The design process continued after the start of the teaching session, with participants engaged in designing the specific modules, weekly materials, or class and online activities. Many of these smaller components were planned for, but not fully prepared before the teaching session.\" (Bennett et al 2017:137)</p> <p>Even after the end of the teaching session, more than half of the participants described reflecting on how the unit could be improved for its next iteration.\" (Bennett et al 2017:137)</p> <p>The participants' accounts suggest that unit design can extend over multiple offerings, rather than being a more tightly defined \"project\"\" (Bennett et al 2017:138)</p> <p>Like Stark (2000), we identified a non-systematic cyclic design process in the accounts of our participants and variation in the steps taken depending on whether they were designing a new unit or revising an existing unit.\" (Bennett et al 2017:139)</p> <p>A noteworthy absence in the data is any reference to the use of models or frameworks to guide the design process.\" (Bennett et al 2017:140)</p> <p>Put simply, regardless of whether participants described beginning with a learning-outcome or content-area focus, their subsequent processes followed a similar top-down process\" (Bennett et al 2017:140)</p> <p>It is important to emphasize that the model we have outlined above is descriptive rather than prescriptive.\" (Bennett et al 2017:140)</p> <p>Although this study helps to understand what teachers currently do, with the intention of informing future support strategies,\" (Bennett et al 2017:141)</p> <p>Although some of our participants mentioned making notes during their design process, none referred to using systematic representations to document their designs.\" (Bennett et al 2017:141)</p> <p>Findings from design studies suggest that design is an iterative endeavor, characterized by an evolving understanding of the problem and its context, drawing on precedent and experience to develop an appropriate solution, subject to constraints on resources (Cross 2006; Goldschmidt 1998).\" (Bennett et al 2017:141)</p> <p>*Highlighting a possible hole which something like the ABC learning approach might help with, especially when integrated with something like a components based content interface.</p> <p>And then also figure out how to encourage the adoption of useful conceptual models into this practice (e.g. Kolb's, Laurliard's conversation theory etc).

Consequently, interest at the national and international level has emerged to explore the best ways of measuring the extent to which competence in this area is being achieved, and how equitable access to this knowledge is within and across countries.

Is it something that we want or need to have? Do we have to be able to measure it? What does it mean in practice? Is it relevant in universities? Of interest to this project is not to define digital literacy, as there is extensive existing literature on the subject, but to gain an understanding of what digital literacy means in practice for people's everyday working and learning lives. This understanding may feed into a better understanding of the definition of digital literacy, but its main goal is to look at what digital literacy means for individuals and groups. The focus is less on functional skills but on how people themselves conceptualise and articulate their understanding of the technology that many use daily. Research such as (Lovell and Baker 2009) indicates that assumptions about 'digital nativity' on the part of university students may be just that and that many students have not had 'universal and uniform digital upbringing.' (Kennedy, Judd et al. 2008) Some of the stories shared here may illustrate just that. A secondary aim is to shed light on people's behaviours and choices in relation to digital technology that can contribute to a number of fields working with the concept of digital literacy. Stories from current work-in-progress will be shared about how people experience digital technology and how they understand that experience. These stories will be examined to try to answer questions about what meanings people create for themselves around their experience. The social context of digital technology and the rules and norms around technology use that have an impact on people's comfort with, and ability to use, digital technology will also be discussed.</p>"},{"location":"sense/Digital%20Literacy/exploring-digital-literacy-moving-from-buzzwords-toward-a-social-construction-of-competency.html#source","title":"Source","text":"<p>Ostini, Jenny (2014) Exploring digital literacy: moving from buzzwords towards a social construction of competency.

Structures put in place by the vendor or perhaps the local IT group. Not necessarily a bad thing, but one of the big problems is those structures tend to close down on-going emergence.  i.e. they limit positive feedback - in the form of useful on-going interactions (student/student, student/teacher, teacher/teacher, teacher &amp; student/learning analytics etc) - which in turn limits the emergency of new, more appropriate structures/patterns.  Structures that better fit the individual variances and complexities of each different need for learning analytics.</p> <p>On the other hand, tools like OnTask, SRES and EASI (in somewhat different ways) enable on-going interactions which allow varying levels of emergence. EASI achieved it through the EASI crew being deeply emeshed in the CQU context and being able to inject contextual needs into the tool. Both initially and through some evolution. OnTask/SRES achieve this by placing more reliance on the people using the tool to inject their specific contextual needs into the data included into and the use of the tool. This is not easy to do. It typically requires some additional assistance from meso level practitioners to inject that contextual stuff. In the video they talk about this being the energy that's required for emergence.</p> <p>Aside - What I wonder about OnTask and SRES is the difference in how they've evolved over time.

Courses and classroom activities should be developed on the basis of helping students discover and construct knowledge, not on the basis of what the instructor wants to talk about.

Otherwise, instructors risk more than just appearing \"out of touch\" \u2014 they risk developing ineffective educational experiences. Course planning involves predicting the effects of learning activities on a group of students, and to make successful predictions, we must have relevant knowledge about those whose behaviors we are trying to predict.7 For these reasons, experienced teachers advocate for instructors (particularly new instructors) to collect information about their students at the beginning of the semester, either by administering a questionnaire or by giving a short ungraded test that directly measures background knowledge.8 These efforts could help inform instructors about their students' interests, abilities, demographics, and skill sets, and ideally, the remainder of the course would be tailored to the general characteristics measured in this initial survey. source</p>"},{"location":"sense/Know%20thy%20student/providing-aggregate-student-data-to-instructors.html#related-categories","title":"Related categories","text":"<ul> <li>know-thy-student</li> </ul>"},{"location":"sense/Know%20thy%20student/understand-the-user.html","title":"Understand the user","text":"<p>Alan Kay in comment 27 on this post writes</p> <p>the number one principle in good UI design is to understand the users who are being designed for (this is importantly similar to \u201cthe number one principle in trying to teach X to Y\u201d, is to understand Y as well as understanding X).</p> <p>Which he then connects to attempts to develop a framework for CS that should have started with understanding the children.</p> <p>Linking to the Know Thy Students stuff.</p>"},{"location":"sense/Know%20thy%20student/understand-the-user.html#related-categories","title":"Related categories","text":"<ul> <li>know-thy-student</li> </ul>"},{"location":"sense/Learning/brain-plasticity.html","title":"Brain Plasticity","text":"<p>See also: learning, technology-changes-us</p>"},{"location":"sense/Learning/brain-plasticity.html#london-taxi-drivers-have-big-brains","title":"London taxi drivers have \"big brains\"","text":"<p>Maguire et al (2006) use structural MRIs to demonstrate the London taxi drivers' increasing experience navigating the streets of London results in their brains changing </p> <p>years of navigation experience correlated with hippocampal gray matter volume only in taxi drivers, with right posterior gray matter volume increasing (Maguire et al, 2006, p. 1091)</p>"},{"location":"sense/Learning/brain-plasticity.html#references","title":"References","text":"<p>Maguire, E.

(Dron and Anderson, 2022, p. 2)</p> <p>By examining how pedagogical approaches have developed in a complex dance with tools and systems that enable them, we seek to highlight how distance learning pedagogies owe their origins to in-person learning, how this has impacted their development, and how the pedagogical pathways of open and distance learning have increasingly diverged from their in-person ancestors. (Dron and Anderson, 2022, p. 2)</p> <p>Alan Kay quipped, \"'technology' is anything invented after you were born (as cited in Brand, 2008, loc. 189),\" (Dron and Anderson, 2022, p. 2)</p> <p>From a na\u00efve perspective, new technologies of in-person learning are typically introduced into an already well-established system rather than changing the system itself. The tools are usually incrementally better ways of addressing the same problems, and their significance is usually limited because they seldom change structural components of the overall system. This helps to entrench a widespread belief that pedagogy must come first (e.g., Chumley-Jones, Dobbie, &amp; Alford, 2002; Nation &amp; Evans, 2000; Wilkinson, Forbes, Bloomfield, &amp; Fincham Gee, 2004). (Dron and Anderson, 2022, p. 3)</p> <p>While pedagogy (in the sense of being the art and science of teaching) underpins all our teaching interventions and is the purpose of what we do, pedagogies (by which we mean methods of teaching or instructional methods) never come first. There are countless other technologies (from curricula to timetables to classroom architecture) that impose limits and create problems that pedagogies must solve (Dron and Anderson, 2022, p. 3)</p> <p>Pedagogical methods evolve in a specific context in which they solve new problems and take advantage of new opportunities. (Dron and Anderson, 2022, p. 4)</p> <p>Perhaps the most fundamental problem that an in-person pedagogy has to solve is motivation. (Dron and Anderson, 2022, p. 4)</p> <p>Self determination theory posits that, for intrinsic motivation to occur, support must occur for autonomy (students must feel in control), competence (students must feel capable of overcoming meaningful challenge), and relatedness (students must feel that there is social value and meaning in the activity) (Ryan &amp; Deci, 2017) (Dron and Anderson, 2022, p. 4) Hence driving questions as important for relatedness. But also the visual to some extent</p> <p>Some of the most common solutions to these problems just make them worse. Notably, the use of extrinsic rewards and punishments such as grades and gold stars, though achieving some kind of motivation (in the sense of encouraging students to comply with teachers' demands), reliably and persistently inhibits intrinsic motivation (Deci, 1972; Gneezy &amp; Rustichini, 2000; Kohn, 1999) (Dron and Anderson, 2022, p. 4)</p> <p>Lecturers who enthuse, who ask questions that intrigue students, who seek to know their students so that they can make connections with their interests, and so on are dealing with these issues, as are those who take advantage of the inherent social nature of the situation by encouraging discussion or just by remembering every student's name. (Dron and Anderson, 2022, p. 4)</p> <p>In our previous work (Anderson &amp; Dron, 2011), we described the evolution of pedagogies in distance education as falling into three fairly distinct generations (Dron and Anderson, 2022, p. 5)</p> <p>each of which was codetermined not just by developments in pedagogical knowledge but by changes in the affordances and constraints of the information and communication technologies that emerged during each period, as well as other systemic factors (Dron and Anderson, 2022, p. 5)</p>"},{"location":"sense/Learning/pedagogical-paradigms.html#objectivism-a-paradigm-of-teaching","title":"Objectivism: A Paradigm of Teaching","text":"<p>The objectivist paradigm, as the name implies, involves pedagogies that assume both that there is an objective reality to learn about and that there are clearly defined objectives to be achieved. (Dron and Anderson, 2022, p. 6)</p> <p>There are two broad psychological models underpinning this paradigm. The first (behaviorist) focuses on ways to bring about terminal behaviors. The second (cognitivist) focuses on the ways that people are believed to learn, in terms of internal cognitive processes.

(Dron and Anderson, 2022, p. 6)</p> <p>In reality, learners rarely followed such instructions to the letter (Haughey &amp; Muirhead, 2005). Additional pedagogies used by the learners themselves in their homes or offices were seldom observed, because they could not be observed (Dron and Anderson, 2022, p. 6)</p> <p>It is significant that not only were these distance universities but they were also open, meaning that many of their students lacked formal qualifications or experience, unlike the highly selective models of the vast majority of conventional universities. Again, this was heavily influenced by technological factors.

Subjectivist theories acknowledge that learning is a subjective process in which knowledge is constructed in the context of existing knowledge. There are two main models in this paradigm, the cognitive constructivist and the social constructivist. (Dron and Anderson, 2022, p. 7)</p> <p>he cognitive constructivist model, epitomized in the work of Piaget (1970), focuses on how knowledge is constructed by individuals. The more influential social constructivist model, which builds on the work of Dewey (1938) and Vygotsky (1978), sees construction of knowledge as both an individual and a shared process, in which not only is individual knowledge constructed with, for, and through others, but knowledge itself is perceived as a social and situated phenomenon. (Dron and Anderson, 2022, p. 7)</p> <p>The focus of subjectivist models is on how we know and how we come to know: these are not (Dron and Anderson, 2022, p. 7)</p> <p>theories of teaching, as such, but of learning. They do not dictate any particular method, though they do imply that some approaches -- especially those that involve social interaction, open-ended tasks, and active engagement -- will be more promising than the typically instructivist approaches of objectivist models. (Dron and Anderson, 2022, p. 8)</p> <p>A wide range of research-backed theories and models emerged from this, such as communities of inquiry (Garrison &amp; Anderson, 2003), transactional distance (Moore, 1993), and curated or shared web explorations (Furuta, 2000). (Dron and Anderson, 2022, p. 8)</p> <p>Though subjectivist pedagogies acknowledge that every learner will learn something different, and in different ways, their context of application remains firmly rooted in the institutional paradigms of mediaeval universities. Subjectivism focuses on collaborative processes to support shared but largely teacher-led goals, and though its emblematic view of the teacher is that of a \"guide on the side\" rather than a \"sage on a stage,\" the role of the teacher is as leader of a named group of students, who retains control, who assesses student learning, and who establishes and enforces group norms and rules.

Learning must, by necessity, inherit the same characteristics, and the knowledge that results does reside not only in the heads of students but also in the networks of both individuals and the physical or conceptual artifacts they create. Complexivist (Dron and Anderson, 2022, p. 8)</p> <p>heories posit that individual knowledge cannot be neatly separated from the knowledge of others and that our minds are not just phenomena emerging in the brains but are extended and instantiated in the world around us; that learning is an inherently complex, unrepeatable phenomenon, always including emergent as well as planned consequences; that learners must be active agents, in control of their own learning; and that connections between what we learn matter as much as or more than what they connect.

This theory states that psychological procedures, whatever their form, alter the level and strength of self-efficacy. It is hypothesized that expectations of personal efficacy determine whether coping behavior will be initiated, how much effort will be expended, and how long it will be sustained in the face of obstacles and aversive experiences. Persistence in activities that are subjectively threatening but in fact relatively safe produces, through experiences of mastery, further enhancement of self-efficacy and corresponding reductions in defensive behavior. In the propose model, expectations of personal efficacy are derived from four principal sources of information: performance accomplishments, vicarious experience, verbal persuasion, and physiological states. The more dependable the experiential sources, the greater are the changes in perceive self-efficacy. A number of factors are identified as influencing the cognitive processing of efficacy information arising from enactive, vicarious, exhortative, and emotive sources. The differential power of diverse therapeutic procedures is analyzed in terms of the postulated cognitive mechanism of operation. Findings are reported from microanalyses of enactive, vicarious, and emotive modes of treatment that support the hypothesized relationship between perceived self-efficacy and behavioral changes.

The change in phenomena that could be orchestrated contributed to the upsurge in proctoring software adoption by educational institutions.

Dron's (2021) definition of educational technology suggests that pedagogy is technology meaning that such advice translates into \"focus on technology not technology\" and \"putting the technologic horse in front of the technology cart\". i.e. redundantly tautological and somewhat less than useful.  But worse than that, pedagogy before technology can be just as harmful and constraining as technology before pedagogy.  Fawns (2020) identifies the more common issue where a method (e.g. lecture or tutorial) is chosen first and results in the same type of inappropriate choices and unsuitable experiences that arise when a specific digital technology is chosen first. </p> <p>Fawns (2020) defines pedagogy as </p> <p>pedagogy is the thoughtful combination of methods, technologies, social and physical designs and on-the-fly interactions to produce learning environments, student experiences,... A definition that seems to position pedagogy as the orchestration of phenomena for purpose. For example, the orchestration you and your students do during a tutorial in one of the rooms above.There appears a similar connection between Dron's conceptions and Fawns' (2020) postdigital view in the recognition of the situated nature of technolgy. For Fawns this is the integration of the technologies with the social and material environment. For Dron it's how the web of different technologies in a tutorial room and the broader institutional setting are orchestrated.  </p> <p>Further resonance is evident in Fawns' suggestion that </p> <p>(context + purpose) drives (pedagogy [ which includes actual uses of technology]) and Arthur's definition of technology as the orchestration of phenomena for a purpose. The question of the best phenomena and orchestration is measured against how well it helps achieve the purpose.</p> <p>This separation of pedagogy and technology into two separate worlds is evident in the institutional practice of learning and teaching. The most explicit evidence of this are organisational structures that creates separate organisational units responsible for pedagogy and digital technology. Leading to the units and their members becoming increasingly focused on their respective phenomena. The pedagogy folk become experts in the principles of the latest pedagogical focus (e.g. employability, work integrated learning etc.) as the digital technology folk become experts in the nature of the latest technological focus (e.g. O365).

Different technologies enable and perhaps enable different types of orchestration and produce different types of assembly.</p> <p>Evidence for this difference is visible in the history for Australian higher education where there have been universities that were on-campus only, primarily print-based distance education, dual mode, and primarily online.</p>"},{"location":"sense/Paper-Ideas/exploring-conceptions-of-technology.html#the-lms-is-both-too-soft-difficult-and-too-hard","title":"The LMS is both too soft (difficult) and too hard","text":"<p>The LMS is not a single technology.

For example, a previous institution had the practice of creating different course sites for different offerings of a course. Meaning that students in each offering were starting from a clean slate. Any residue of experience (Riel and Polin, 2004) from earlier offerings is lost. In this example the LMS-based course site was orchestrated into a broader assembly of technologies that includes an external social bookmarking and annotation tool (Diigo). Softening the LMS and enabling some development of a shared residue of experience.</p> <p>Most universities seek to harden the soft (make the difficult, easier) technology of a LMS site through the development of a institutional standard course shell/look and feel. A specific assembly of features that provide a consistent set of features across all courses with the ultimate aim of increase the quality of the learner experience while reducing the workload required to provide it. In what many see as the best scenario course development is not done by the teacher, but instead course development is orchestrated into a broader assembly that includes on a team of people with expertise in content, learning design, and technology that use a systematic design process to develop the course.</p> <p>But these resulting assemblies (technologies) then have limitations that then lead to different types of assemblies.

A challenge recently expressed in the Productivity Commission\u2019s \u201cAdvancing Prosperity\u201d report with its recommendations to grow access to tertiary education while containing cost and improving quality. This challenge to maximise all cost efficiency and quality and access (diversity &amp; scale) is seen as a key issue for higher education (Ryan et al., 2021). It has even been labelled the \u201cIron Triangle\u201d because \u2013 unless you change the circumstances and conditions \u2013 improving one indicator will almost inevitably lead to deterioration in the other indicators (Mulder, 2013). The pandemic emergency response being the most recent example of this. Necessarily rapid changes to access (moving from face-to-face to online) required significant costs (staff workload) to produce outcomes that are perceived to be of questionable quality.</p> <p>Leading to the question we wanted to answer:</p> <p>How do you stretch the iron triangle? (i.e. maximise cost efficiency, quality, and accessibility)?</p> <p>In the presentation, we demonstrated that the fundamental tasks (gather and weave) of an LMS migration are manual and repetitive. Making it impossible to stretch the iron triangle. We illustrated why this is the case, demonstrated how we addressed this limitation, and proposed three principles for broader application. We argue that the three principles can be usefully applied beyond LMS migration to business as usual.</p>"},{"location":"sense/Paper-Ideas/gatherers-weavers-augmenters.html#gatherers-and-weavers--what-we-do","title":"Gatherers and weavers \u2013 what we do","text":"<p>Our job is to help academic staff design, implement, and maintain quality learning tasks and environments. We suggest that the core tasks required to do this is to gather and weave disparate strands of knowledge, ways of knowing (especially various forms of design and contextual knowledge and knowing), and technologies (broadly defined). For example, a course site is the result of gathering and weaving together such disparate strands as: content knowledge (e.g. learning materials); administrative information (e.g. due dates, timetables etc); design knowledge (e.g. pedagogical, presentation, visual etc); and information &amp; functionality from various technologies (e.g. course profiles, echo360, various components of the LMS etc).</p> <p>An LMS migration is a variation on this work. It has a larger (all courses) and more focused purpose (migrate from one LMS to another). But still involves the same core tasks of gathering and weaving. Our argument is that to maximise the cost efficiency, accessibility, and quality of this work you must do the same to the core tasks of gathering and weaving. Early in our LMS migration it was obvious that this was not the case. The presentation included a few illustrative examples. There were many more that could\u2019ve been used. Both from the migration and business as usual.

Digital technology is increasingly pervasive in the learning and teaching environment, especially in the context of an LMS migration. But none of the available technologies were actively helping automate or augment gathering and weaving. The presentation included numerous examples of how we changed this. From this work we identified three principles.</p> <ol> <li>On-going activity focused (re-)entanglement.     Our work was focused on high level activities (e.g. analysis, migration, quality assurance, course design of 100s of course sites). Activities not supported by any single technology, hence the manual gathering and weaving. By starting small and continually responding to changes and lessons learned, we stretched the iron triangle by digitally gathering and weaving disparate component technologies into assemblages that were fit for the activities.</li> <li>Contextual digital augmentation.     Little to none of the specific contextual and design knowledge required for these activities was available digitally. We focused on usefully capturing this knowledge digitally so it could be integrated into the activity-based assemblages.</li> <li>Meso-level focus.     Existing component technologies generally provide universal solutions for the institution or all users of the technology. Requiring manual gathering and weaving to fit contextual needs for each individual variation. By leveraging the previous two principles we were able to provide \u201ctechnologies that were fit for meso-level solutions. For example, all courses for a program or a school.

Difficulty increased due to many issues, including: competition with the private sector for digital talent; battling concerns over the casualisation and perceived importance of teaching; and, growing expectations around ethics, diversity, and sustainability. That this challenge is unresolved and becoming increasingly difficult suggests a need for innovative practices in both learning and teaching, and how learning and teaching is enabled. Starting in 2019 and accelerated by a Learning Management System (LMS) migration starting in 2021 a small group have been refining and using an alternate set of principles and practices to respond to this challenge by developing reusable orchestrations \u2013 organised arrangements of actions, tools, methods, and processes (Dron, 2022) \u2013 to sustainably, and at scale, fulfill diverse requirements for quality learning and teaching. Leading to a process where requirements are informed through collegial networks of learning and teaching stakeholders that weigh their objective strategic and contextual concerns to inform priority and approach. Helping to share knowledge and concerns and develop institutional capability laterally and in recognition of available educator expertise.</p> <p>The presentation will be structured around three common tasks: quality assurance of course sites; migrating content between two LMS; and, designing effective course sites.

For those working in an educational context, this impact has been lockdown and the enforced closure of schools, colleges and universities (Watermeyer et al., 2020). In response, institutions were bound to transition and scale up online teaching to ensure that learning would not be completely disrupted (Burki, 2020). This migration seemingly happened overnight (Dhawan, 2020) and has, consequently, mostly been characterised as adventitious, rapid and incipient (Johnson, Veletsianos, &amp; Seaman, 2020). As described by Tesar (2020), every course moved online in a matter of days whether or not staff had any online teaching experience. For many, the headlong thrust into providing learning experiences for students via a digital interface has been confusing, unfamiliar and unwanted (Johnson et al., 2020; Watermeyer et al., 2020). Some experienced discomfort and anxiety not only due to the technology but also from being forced to employ new pedagogical techniques at a moment\u2019s notice (Johnson et al., 2020). Such a transition to emergency remote learning and teaching has provided fodder for previous critiques that online learning has not been extensively thought through and has received only \u201cminimal meaningful investment\u201d (Tesar, 2020, p. 557). Findings from Watermeyer et al., (2020) survey of over a thousand academics working in universities in the United Kingdom revealed that they had been wounded from engaging with emergency online transition and, subsequently, become disillusioned and distrustful \u201cof a more prolonged and substantial embrace of digital pedagogies by their institution\u201d (p. 14). Concerns have also been expressed about how it is possible that courses can offer the same opportunities and learning outcomes online as on-campus (Fawns, Jones, &amp; Aitken, 2020). However, some have adopted more optimistic tones arguing that higher education has long been \u201coverdue for a complete overhaul\u201d (Watermeyer et al., 2020, p. 14). Other worries have legitimately centred around the mental health of students given that studying online may be an isolating experience and that they may be unable to access support structures (Fawns et al., 2020; Fazackerley, 2020). Unsurprisingly, several have cited an increased and more intense workload as they accommodate an escalation in the pastoral needs of students and as their personal and professional lives blur together whilst working from home (Kirk, 2020). In surveying close to 900 faculty and administrators at various institutions in the United States, Johnson et al., (2020) determined that most desire substantial information and guidance on best practices related to online teaching, providing weight to the suggestion by Watermeyer et al., (2020) that in the rush to perform online migration of courses academics are employing \u201centry-level\u201d digital pedagogies (p. 1). Consequently, whilst the pandemic has accelerated the inevitability of a widespread adoption of online learning, there exists a concern that the rapid response to online may have resulted in prejudicial and distorted views of digital pedagogies from the academic community to the extent to which any future changes to their roles will \u201cbe viewed only through the lens of precarisation\u201d (Watermeyer et al., 2020, p. 15).</p>"},{"location":"sense/Paper-Ideas/conceptions/covid-response-outcomes.html","title":"COVID Response outcomes","text":""},{"location":"sense/Paper-Ideas/conceptions/covid-response-outcomes.html#from-bellaby-et-al","title":"From Bellaby et al","text":"<p>Although the impact of COVID-19 and the emergency migration of online courses is irrefutably seismic, we are merely at the beginning of being able to recognise the full impacts of this on higher education. Indeed, much of the literature is embryonic and mostly relies on speculation to form assertions on the changing nature of the educational landscape and a post-pandemic pedagogy. Nevertheless, it seems safe to surmise that \u201cshift to online learning looks set to continue at least until the advent of a successful vaccine for COVID-19\u201d (Burki, 2020, p.  758). Dhawan (2020) has declared that teaching online is no longer a choice but a necessity, going so far as to optimistically proclaim it a \u201cpanacea for the crisis\u201d (p. 3). He (Dhawan, 2020) also cautions that the quality of online courses amidst the crisis will determine an institution\u2019s reputation. Watermeyer et el., (2020) similarly speculates that only those institutions that provide a quality online experience will gain market advantage.</p>"},{"location":"sense/Paper-Summaries/consistency-is-key-in-online-learning.html","title":"Consistency is key in online learning: Evaluating student and instructor perceptions","text":"<p>Scutelnicu, G., Tekula, R., Gordon, B., &amp; Knepper, H.

In this talk, I will discuss the inadvertent role higher education plays in teaching students to passively accept broad forms of digital surveillance and control through its use of popular educational technologies like learning management systems, word processing software, and test taking tools, and how this submission leads to the broader mass helplessness in the face of current technological struggles. Starting with my chance encounter with free software as a humanities graduate student, I will highlight a range of promising contemporary examples of experiments in higher education that push against exploitative trends in educational technology and expose students to the differentiating value and possibility of software freedom.

Why?</p> <p>Perhaps it is because the translation of the design problem into practice/artefact is more straight forward and consistent in OO programming than higher ed L&amp;T. In OO programming, the design pattern the software developer translates it into code (that can be tested etc) using increasingly fairly common integrated development practices and tools.  Knowledge of those practices and tools are seen as fairly central to the expertise of the software developer. Software development itself has quite an explicit focus on improving the developer experience. On the other hand, in higher ed L&amp;T translating a design pattern into a learning environment relies on the complex gathering and weaving of of whatever random collection of physical/digital tools and processes within their individual institution. This complex gathering and weaving is not typically seen as central to the expertise of the practitioner. Often quite the opposite. Also, there is typically no on-going focus on \"teacher experience\" that echoes the focus on the \"developer experience\". 2. The \"what's missing\" from design patterns provides small suggestion of piece for CASA work the ability to translate the patterns into LMS (the learning environment). Which links explicitly to this paper's point about learning being constrained by the learning environment and the point of educational design is the appropriate redesign of the learning environment. There is also the point about the need for alignment with task, activity, environment which very much echoes the intent behind the casa work 3. What's the value/impact of separating educational design from educational development? Are the two clearly separated? Especially in the context of latter suggestions from Goodyear around short arc design and embedding ideas into tools (long-and-short-arc-learning-design) 4. \"networked learning\" focuses on using digital technology to promote connections, what about taking that same focus to make connections between design, development, teacher practice etc, i.e. taking a much more forward-oriented-design approach 5.

Emergent strategy is still useful.

Massy et al. (2012) describe the measurement of teaching quality as the elephant in the room in determining the productivity of learning and teaching in higher education noting that none of the (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 1)</p> <p>approaches currently employed are sufficiently robust to be included in a determination of quality. (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 2)</p> <p>There is also recognition within the sector that to improve the quality of learning and teaching, the discrete elements in the effort chain must be integrated and addressed holistically (Probert 2015). However, for reasons we will explain in this chapter and throughout the book, a scaled, integrated, and holistic approach has not occurred in higher education. We will show that each link in the chain falters because of a failure to fully understand the context in which learning and teaching occurs. (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 2)</p> <p>The cornerstone of a professional context in any field is comparable and visible professionally controlled practice (Bowker and Star 2000). Comparability means the use of evidence-based approaches across multiple settings and individuals. Visibility means work processes that are observable and make use of evidence-based approaches in ways that can differentiate among more or less effective practice (Bowker and Star 2000). Comparability and visibility produce workable distinctions in routine practice (Drengenberg and Bain 2016). In higher education, workable distinctions mean a visible and comparable difference in the quality of learning and teaching practice in normal work that can be used to make a valid and reliable determination of quality (Drengenberg and Bain 2016). Professional Control is a managed professional process that makes standardization and differentiation of practice possible while retaining a degree of professional flexibility and autonomy (Bowker and Star 2000) . The term control is used here to denote a process of dynamic management and evaluation of comparable and visible practice, as opposed to something that restricts or constrains. (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 3)</p> <p>Not only do universities lack the models of practice at scale required to impact learning and teaching quality, they lack the internal analytic and evaluation systems, methods and tools to measure what they are doing in valid and reliable ways (Bain and Drengenberg 2016). This is not because of a lack of research and practical guidance. Extensive longitudinal research exists related to efficacious practice in learning design (e.g., Biggs and Tang 2007; Koper 2006), assessment (e.g., Sadler 2005; Wiggins 1998), and pedagogy (e.g., Hattie 2008, 2015; Marzano 1998), and approaches for implementing protocols derived from these practices. The issue is whether universities have the capacity to design themselves in ways that employ an understanding of the learning and teaching context to produce professionally controlled practice for the benefit of all faculty and students. To alter these circumstances requires an understanding of what learning and teaching means with sufficient clarity to establish differences or distinctions in the quality of practice at scale. (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 5)</p> <p>Governance practices focus on mitigating organizational risk over curricular innovation or best practice by amplifying institutional requirements for efficiency and compliance that lack any known impact on student learning (Coate and Tooher 2010). For example, governance processes are frequently built around the kind of standards we just described that lack a foundation of visible and comparable evidence-based practice. (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 7)</p> <p>Satisfaction is no guarantee of quality under current circumstances. For example, consumers can be satisfied with a service/product that does not work as claimed or at all, is unnecessary, or performs poorly, if at a given point in time it represents state-of-the-art knowledge or is the subject of a successful marketing and sales effort. The history of all fields is replete with examples of this phenomenon (e.g., bloodletting in medicine, bottled water, snake oil in pharmacology). Student evaluations in universities are an expression of satisfaction with an experience that does not reflect evidence-based professional control at any scale beyond the practice of an individual teacher. (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 9)</p> <p>If an institution has not assigned value to what it means by pedagogy, feedback, appropriate resources, etc., (a model of learning and teaching), and then seeks to evaluate quality teaching, the best that can be expected from such an effort is a determination of student satisfaction with whatever a faculty member believes to be good teaching practice. (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 9)</p> <p>The fundamental problem: Their work does not occur within a context of professionally controlled practice that would make possible the scalable influence that is frequently at the core of their mandate. **Those who lead these centers are required to provide high-level advice and leadership although their roles rarely extend to creating the kind of context, the fundamental structural change required to realize the aspirations their organizations have for the centers they lead (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 12) **</p> <p>While there may be an intent to make universities better at learning and teaching as a whole, centers for learning and teaching are designed for something else: (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 12)</p> <p>To influence learning and teaching through elective, selective, and exemplary approaches that are incompatible with whole-of-organizational change. By elective, selective, and exemplary, we mean approaches that offer elective capacity building and support for promotion; recognize excellence selectively through awards and grants; seek to demonstrate impact by example as opposed to scalable systemic effect, and where all of these actions occur within a context free of professional control. The expectation seems to be that exemplary practice sponsored by such centers will somehow exert a kind of osmotic effect on the whole organization which never happens at the scale required to influence quality overall. (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 12)</p> <p>Without models of scalable practice, centers become supporters and guides on the side for good works and better practice, identifying and recognizing academics who pursue excellence, providing and facilitating grants for those who are trying to innovate, participating in the development of policies, frameworks, producing papers and disseminating resources about effective practice and assuming roles and responsibilities in the existing governance processes. (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 12)</p> <p>We explain how an understanding of context creates the conditions for a new approach entitled Edge technology (Bain and Weston 2011) that reflect the context and leverages emergent feedback. (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 22)</p> <p>So, the tools people use in normal work can help them design and deliver courseware in ways that make it easier to incorporate comparable and visible evidence-based practice. The design of the tools helps users to employ professionally controlled practice. In this way, the tools have a virtual form of agency independent of their users (Levy 2001). (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 22)</p> <p>Their design and functionality are a mirror of the university's learning and teaching model and context (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 22)</p> <p>An organization's design is an expression of its schema---its beliefs and process. Beliefs and process are expressed in methods and tools, roles and responsibilities, how individuals contribute, and the way the organization as a whole addresses problems and develops more or less successful courses of action. Both the schema and those that work with it possess agency that functions in a reinforcing feedback loop. The organization's schema drives roles and responsibilities that shape individual perspectives on needs, priorities, and performance indicators. How this happens will affect schema development (Auhl, in progress). (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 28) get auhl</p> <p>The Pre-contextual Grandbridge approach to learning and teaching is an example of the effort chain described in Chap. 1---a loose coupling (Weick 1976) of awards, grants, governance, capacity building, promotion frameworks, and surveys none of which are underpinned by professionally controlled practice at a whole-of-organization scale. In line with Conway's Law, Pre-contextual Grandbridge's strategic planning mirrors its effort chain schema and design and the agency of those who work within its social structure. Its strategic plan amplifies its existing approach with more capacity building, more awards, more gran (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 30)</p> <p>The greatest single challenge associated with the improvement of learning and teaching in higher education is recognizing that the current effort chain approach and the architectural structures that serve it are incompatible with the whole-of-organization improvement in learning and teaching represented in mission and value statements and strategic plans and so desired by universities. (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 33)</p> <p>Grandbridge SOU employs a process known as Commons-Based Peer Production (Benkler 2002) an approach used to develop open source software, industry standards and guidelines, and nanotechnologies (Maurer 2010b). Commons-Based Peer Production (CBPP) can be defined as any process whereby individuals can freely and openly contribute to a common pool (of knowledge, code, and design) (Bauwens 2014). CBPP is a decentralized alternative to hierarchical development processes for the peer production of what are frequently complex products (Benkler 2016). CBPP pools collective intelligence in a proactive production process that permits the inclusion of a broad base of perspectives and motivations (Vuculescu 2012). Wikipedia is the best known and most widely used example CBPP where anyone can author or edit a contribution within a simple rule and oversight structure. There are three phases in the CPBB for policy development in the SOU. First, the community builds definitions and examples to clarify the meaning of its commitments. The instantiated commitments are then used to develop policy statements. The statements are then evaluated, refined, and organized to become a policy document. Example 2.3 describes the process as employed by Grandbridge.

(Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 45)</p> <p>According to Dede (2006, 2016), an innovation needs to possess the requisite scope and depth required to be scalable. Most change processes in education are dependent on altering the way educators engage in their normal work---how they think act and feel about what they do every day in their professional lives. While the specific target of an innovation may be a new approach to assessment, curriculum, teaching, or technology, the support required for successful implementation at scale is frequently of much broader scope and depth than that usually assumed by change agents. All too often, change efforts target the immediate conditions required to make the change happen (e.g., providing professional development to upskill faculty members in an assessment, curriculum or teaching approach, or ensuring a new technology is in place). This approach fails to recognize the way change impacts individual faculty members more broadly and the scope and depth of effort required to support a change at scale. (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 49)</p> <p>The point here is that major social and technological1 shifts require much more work than simply building out the core or primary innovation. They call for a network of broad and deep coevolving and reinforcing innovations and circumstances if they are to adapt dynamically to ongoing change. (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 52)</p> <p>We also know the efforts to border cross from old to new technologies (e.g., Weston and Brooks 2008) are made immensely challenging because these dynamic coevolving circumstances (the roads, gas stations, mechanics, etc.) rarely emerge as part of a smooth and timely transition. They all too frequently include many false starts, failures, gaps, and incomplete solutions before a new technology emerges at scale as a robust alternative to the prevailing approach. Further, in the early stages of an innovation the development of the many coevolving elements fall to the developers or change agents in the absence of the kind of dispersed control and modularization that occurs when an innovation is more mature (Horn 2014). (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 52)</p> <p>Agent-based design involves describing a system from the perspective of its constituent units in order to understand the interaction of key elements (Bonabeau 2002). The approach focuses on sampling and modeling the interaction of agents in a real working context to understand the topology of that work and the rules and relationships that apply, including the way those agents engage in networked collaboration with their peers (Macal and North 2010). This information can then be used to drive software design. Most models of agent-based design involve an analysis of the need or problem, the situation or context and then the development of tools or process required to solve the problem (Bain and Drengenberg 2016; Billari et al. 2006; Macal and North 2010; Doran 2006). (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 55) Need to find out more about this and its relation to other approaches.\u00a0 Agile/distributed development works more in reality.\u00a0 Agent based approaches appear to assume you can model the system.\u00a0 Questionable?</p> <p>The full scope of software development required to enable learning and teaching practice in the SOU approach is taken up in Chap. 7 as it relates to program design, program mapping, learning design assessment, and feedback. Example 3.1 shows in one area (designing cooperative learning experiences), the way evidence-based practice can be embedded in tools to produce workable distinctions in learning and teaching that can ultimately lead to the determination of the valid and reliable standards of practice. It is also important to note that we are not conflating the existence of the software with using it at scale to achieve better learning design. The existence of commitments, policy and tools represent a beginning in this regard although more needs to be done to create the coevolved and self-reinforcing circumstances necessary for professionally controlled practice at scale.

(Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 62) THere are suggestions that there are issues with this figure</p> <p>We also noted in Chap. 1 that the uptake of professional development opportunities in learning and teaching is frequently low (Probert 2015) and faculty members are often skeptical about the value of those opportunities. This is unsurprising given the research on the efficacy of professional development (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 67)</p> <p>PD fails in the pre-contextual university because it is expected to be the silver bullet driver of change instead of filling a meaningful role within an embedded design. (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 67)</p> <p>By this we mean professional development needs to be a role player embedded within a broader interconnected and supportive learning and teaching context instantiated by commitments, policy, technology, role, governance and career trajectory that function interdependently and coevolve to create a new schema for learning and teaching practice. Most often PD is expected to carry forward a loosely articulated pre-contextual design approach (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 67)</p> <p>n interdependently and coevolve to create a new schema for learning and teaching practice. (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 67)</p> <p>The scope, depth, and coevolutionary nature of the embedded design process stands in contrast to the loose coupling (Weick 1976) that is the hallmark of the pre-contextual effort chain organizational structure of universities. Loose coupling is characterized by an absence of regulation, loose organizational arrangements, lack of consensus, and low levels of coordination (Weick 1976; Orton and Weick 1990). Since Weick's seminal work, many pre-contextual universities have worn loose coupling like a badge of honor invoking it as an effective organizational form consistent with effective adaptation to change, responsive decision-making, multiple decision-making pathways, a cultivator of institutional ingenuity, initiative, and flexibility (Orton and Weick 1990). These potentials may exist for organizations in fields that possess fundamental professional control. However, in an echo of Conway's Law, (Conway 1968) the extensive evidence about the inability of universities to determine what learning and teaching mean, the failure to establish what constitutes quality and productivity in relation to student outcomes, along with the inability to exert scalable influence on their core activity (learning and teaching practice) would suggest a symmetry between loose coupling in universities and its outcomes in the pre-contextual university. The touted benefits may reside more in the realm of myth than reality when applied to learning and teaching in higher educatio (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 68)</p> <p>The tighter coupling in the SOU creates the support and functional cohesion (TheBojan 2015) required for an organization to function professionally at scale. In essence, it is the order required to replace top down control (Bain 2007) where there exists a shared understanding and schema for collaborative professionally controlled practice.

Taking up the inconsistency across faculties is a perfect target for them as that agenda lines up perfectly with the expectations of the Pre-contextual Grandbridge leadership, their (the consultants) capabilities, and avoids the difficult question of what should be happening in terms of learning and teaching at scale across the university. The inconsistencies across faculties are assumed to be problematic although no one really knows about the relationship between the support of learning and teaching and their quality and productivity at Pre-contextual Grandbridge or anywhere else (Drengenberg and Bain 2016). (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 92)</p> <p>The new experts and expanded entities will assume responsibility for learning and teaching to whom faculty members then become accountable. Because there is no shared schema and practice, roles intended to serve the faculty members function in the inverse. Faculty members simply get more work to do as they become subject to new requirements and accountabilities because the new entities and roles generate a need to be served. Some faculty members will attend professional development sessions conducted by the CELT. Others will not. This will stimulate high-level discussions about making professional development compulsory or finding ways to deliver content more easily online. Instead of a shared and collaborative enterprise, learning and teaching become a set of requirements, things that faculty members need to do in order to fulfill expectations and meet new quality standards. (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 93)</p> <p>The successful applicants will take up their positions and invent their own autonomously constructed personal model of Pre-contextual Grandbridge learning and teaching because the university does not have one. They will then report to other people higher up the organizational chart who have responsibility for them and the entities within which they work (Bain and Drengenberg 2016). Those people will use their individually and autonomously constructed personal schema for the Pre-contextual Grandbridge model to lead and judge those they supervise. The black-box reorganization of learning and teaching at Pre-contextual Grandbridge is unable to produce the workable distinctions in the quality and productivity of normal work necessary to lead and manage. Power is centralized with the connoisseurs, the mappers, the experts, and quality controllers whom along with those who lead them assume responsibility for what goes on. Coordination and control are exercised from top to bottom in ways that are directed at the community of learners and teachers not with them. (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 94)</p> <p>An SOU is comprised of a network of learning and teaching teams. All teams operate with the same simple rules or commitments. They are: 1. To implement the model of learning and professional practice; 2. To use emergent feedback to problem-solve learning and teaching needs; 3. To contribute to the ongoing evolution of the model and schema by sharing and acting upon feedback across the community. (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 96)</p> <p>The network is free of hierarchy. Information from discrete learning experiences within courses all the way to whole-of-university performance are available to all of the teams all of the time as they share feedback and problem-solve.

This means how quickly and intelligently they can anticipate or respond to a situation, leveraging their collective perception, memory, insight, vision, planning, reasoning, foresight, and experience into applicable knowledge (Doug Engelbart Institute 2016). Much of Engelbart's work related to augmenting human intellect with technologies to address wicked problems (Engelbart 1962) including the development of hypertext and the computer mouse. The big idea here is that teams are great places for people to share perspectives and insights and pool the collective capacities associated with their membership. (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 103)</p> <p>he cumbersome and disconnected committee structure and process in Pre-contextual Grandbridge is what happens when decision-making data is inadequate, and the edges connecting nodes in the network are either too long or do not exist at all. The idea of definitive high level decision-making is an illusion produced by a hierarchical organizational structure and insufficient feedback. (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 105)</p> <p>Further, attempting to change an organization in the manner described in Example 5.1 is unlikely to have any substantive effect because it does not address the fundamental distance problem between high-level planning and ground-level action and the centrality and complexity of the latter as the fundamental source of solution generation and adaptation in organizations. (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 105)</p> <p>This is more than an issue of elevation but a fundamental difference in what can be reasonably accomplished when information, power, and control exist (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 105)</p> <p>in an abstracted context and when that abstraction is privileged as the primary driver of organizational action. (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 106)</p> <p>This circumstance, which is highly similar from university to university exists in large measure because those leading learning and teaching only have an approximate or analogically reasoned2 understanding of how to build out a valid and reliable learning and teaching approach at scale in their organizations (Bain and Drengenberg 2016). (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 108)</p> <p>Further, given the widely recognized hierarchical and top-down organizational structure of most modern universities (Bleiklie and Kogan 2007), the impact of those leaders is profound. (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 108)</p> <p>Agency is a model of action made possible by a particular body of knowledge that is capable of altering outcomes (Hirschmann 2009). Agency reflects and is developed by the context in which it occurs. (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 109)</p> <p>According to Latour (1996) agency is not restricted to human activity.

(Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 110)</p> <p>There can be nothing more wicked in problem solving than a circumstance whereby those individuals critically positioned to solve a problem do not believe they have one, or understand what the problem is. (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 113)</p> <p>Further, as we described in Chap. 3, the model of providing supplementary professional development in contexts that do not have preexisting professionally controlled practice has not worked in any sector of education (Cole 2012). (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 115)</p> <p>The Pre-contextual Grandbridge leaders have some sense of the interconnectedness that makes the assessment problem wicked although that understanding is constrained by the limits of their individually constructed effort chain schema. They can visualize the pieces in the jigsaw puzzle (e.g., technology, professional development, promotion framework) but there is no deep understanding of each piece and how they fit together because there is no deep understanding of the learning and teaching context and associated professional practice that would imbue the puzzle pieces with meaning. (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 116)</p> <p>The longer Pre-contextual Grandbridge persists with its effort chain approach the more likely it is that leaders will ultimately conceptualize the problem as a compliance issue whereby faculty members are not doing what they need or are meant to do. This is likely to happen because the way the university has separated its strategy from execution. Pressure will be brought to bear on middle managers for failing to effectively implement the leadership strategy at an operational level in ways that echo the separation between the roles of strategy and operations in Pre-contextual Grandbridge's organizational structure. (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 118)</p> <p>What do these quotes say about how we understand learning, teaching, and technology and why as the quotes imply do we see a need to affirm the teacher's role in ways that amplify the distinction between technology and teacher? At play in these quotes and the \"technology as tool\" mantra is an echo of Conway's Law (Conway 1968) first described in Chap. 2 whereby the field unable to define its practice at scale employs technology in a manner that reflects its current architecture and social construction. Technology is just a tool because it is only in the realm of automation (i.e., grades, scheduling, curriculum organization and support and learning management) that the field of education understands and possesses clear line of sight to the role and purpose of technology at scale in educational organizations. The use of technology mirrors the organization's schema for learning and teaching. (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 130)</p> <p>Pre-contextual Grandbridge is also pinning many of its hopes for better learning and teaching on the functionality of the new LMS (the collaboration tools, new learning analytics capability etc.,) and student learning. However, there is no body of research that establishes an attributable relationship between LMS use and student learning and achievement (Means et al. 2014). A recent large scale K-12 study by Kimmons (2015) found that learning management systems account for just 12% of the variance in achievement ratings, a finding that in direction is broadly consistent with those for other learning and teaching technologies including games and simulations, reading and math software, and tutoring systems that have not added significant value to student learning over the existing learning and teaching paradigm (Bain and Drengenberg 2016; Barbour and Reeves 2009; Dynarski et al. 2007; Santoro and Bishop 2010; Smith et al. 2005; Steenbergen-Hu and Cooper 2014). Further, it seems to make little difference whether these applications exist on the desktop, the local server, or in the cloud. Pre-contextual Grandbridge will instead rely on the developers' assertion that simply using the LMS features and functionality will produce successful learning outcomes. However, existing evidence would suggest this is unlikely given there is no known attributable efficacious relationship between the new Pre-contextual Grandbridge LMS and student learning outcomes at scale. (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 132)</p> <p>re-contextual Grandbridge could leverage the LMS for better learning outcomes. If the university possessed a model of professional practice, it could integrate the functionality of the LMS with professionally controlled practice and possibly develop the LMS technology into something new and distinctive. For example, the new chat room functionality of the LMS could be employed in combination with research-based cooperative learning (CL) to build group learning activities that exert a powerful influence on student learning. The interaction of the chat room functionality and CL would mean that well-known achievement-related features of CL including the way accountability, interdependence, and learning tasks (Slavin 1996) are organized and structured could be leveraged by and with the chat room tools for learning effect. Feedback about chat room use would focus on the key achievement-related features of CL. We know that there is a greater (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 132)</p> <p>likelihood of successful student outcomes when technologies are placed within a context of professionally controlled practices that have been shown to influence student learning (Bain and Drengenberg 2016; Hattie 2008; Weston and Bain 2014) (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 133)</p> <p>The university is hoping to assume a position of leadership and distinction in the sector although it is using the same LMS product as its peers in ways that are most likely to produce outcomes highly similar to those peer institutions. While promoted as a key tool for innovation, the reality is that the LMS will simply make pre-contextual Grandbridge more like the other pre-contextual universities with which it competes (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 134)</p> <p>The purpose of technology in the SOU approach is to represent and instantiate a university's learning and teaching model in day-to-day normal work, to improve student learning, generate emergent feedback, and build the organization's learning and teaching capacity. This means embedding the model of learning and teaching and professional practice in tools that generate emergent feedback and produce workable distinctions in routine practice at all levels of the university. Technologies possess the capacity to be agents of actual and virtual professional control (Levy 2001) when they function at the nexus of the learning context, known professional practice, the professional agency of the user, and the affordances of the technology. What is created at that nexus is the product of an interaction among context, user, and technology. (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 134)</p> <p>We describe ICT tools that serve to instantiate the professional context in interactive ways as edge technologies (Bain and Weston 2011). Edge technologies do five things, they: - enact evidence-based protocols for professionally controlled practice in terms of content and process; - connect design, enactment and engagement using the network capability of technology to join these nodes and shorten the edges between them. In network theory, an edge is the connection between two nodes on a network (Barab\u00e1si 2002); - extend and distribute capacity through a collaborative human--machine relationship (Facer and Sandford 2009). They do so by translating protocols into conceptual and then relational schema for action; - enable emergent feedback by connecting learners in open collaborative platforms, shortening the cognitive distance in the learning and teaching network, making feedback an emergent expression of the routine work of design, enactment and engagement. They bring teachers and learners together for collaborative development and feedback; - build capacity. By engaging users routinely in a context that expresses a research-based approach to design, enactment and engagement, users build capacity with both the virtual and actual processes and practice that secure quality learning and teaching. They make research-based collaborative problem-solving possible. (Bain and Drengenberg 2016, p. 124) (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 135)</p> <p>Latour (1994) describes the way the designers of technologies employ scripts or protocols that mediate the interaction of technology and users. Like a movie or play, technologies possess a script that can prescribe the actions of those using them (Verbeek 2006). Scripts anticipate the way a technology will be used and the nature of user interaction. This concept has particular relevance to the role of technology in the SOU and specifically its agency in enabling a relationship between the professional context and the form or design of technological tools for enacting learning and teaching. (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 135)</p> <p>Jane need not have read the extensive literature or be an expert on CL to use the designer. As she interacts with the software she builds capacity with the teaching practice and the interaction between content and pedagogy (Shulman 1986) represented in her design work. Jane could build her learning experience using the pre-contextual LMS chat room to facilitate students working together in some generic sense. However, the chat room design does not possess a proximal connection to those features of CL that produce enhanced student learning outcomes and as a result will not build her capacity with the approach or realize the potential learning benefits to students. (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 138)</p> <p>The example described in this chapter comes from a suite of three technologies in development for higher education learning and teaching (Bain 2012) and described in (Bain and Drengenberg 2016). They include: Technologies for Program Design---The Programspace. The Programspace includes modules for program design including program conceptualization, standards mapping, program outcomes, assessment task, course, and module design. The modules for program design provide a starting point for the learning and teaching process that ultimately generates clear line of sight from design all the way to student performance. Analytic data reflect the connections. Technologies for Course Design and Enactment---The CourseSpace: The CourseSpace includes modules for designing and enacting course learning activities including the pedagogical approaches and the tools to assist users deliver those approaches. The CL designer examples and feedback came from the Coursespace. Student Technologies---The Learningspace: The Learningspace is where students engage with the learning experiences developed in Coursespaces using computer, tablet, or smartphone technology. (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 139)</p> <p>According to Verbeek (2006) technology has meaning within its context of use. Verbeek views the agency of technology as an interaction among context, technology, and user where the technology influences human behavior and capability interactively. In this integration, technologies become an extension of human capability and possess intentions that amplify certain functions and dampen others. They shape experience and contribute to moral decision-making (Verbeek 2006). (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 139)</p> <p>Jane's design for her evaluation course is an expression of her agency and role as an academic at Grandbridge SOU; the context of professional practice that exists at the university, and a technology designed specifically to articulate or express features of that context; in this instance the practice of cooperative learning. By way of comparison, the pre-contextual approach at Grandbridge described in the LMS Example 7.1 engenders a separation of agent, context, and technology because there is no-overarching professional understanding of learning and teaching to bring context, agency, and technology together interactively in professionally controlled ways. Pre-contextual Grandbridge cannot employ knowledge of cooperative learning or other research-based practices to the (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 140)</p> <p>We contend there is a strong similarity in using the features and functionalities of an LMS without knowledge of professionally controlled visible and comparable professional practice and the hypothetical use of the ultrasound without knowledge of prenatal development or the CL designer without knowledge of cooperative learning. Both scenarios would result in a highly attenuated role for the technology that is more likely to engender a perspective that separates context, agency and technology resulting in the focus on technology as a tool or thing. (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 141)</p> <p>As we have shown throughout the book, these assumptions can only be secured when they reflect the challenging day-to-day work of a professionally controlled organization. Because the professional context for learning and teaching at Pre-contextual Grandbridge is essentially a black-box, learning and teaching quality cannot be assumed or assured. At Pre-contextual Grandbridge, the focus is fixed on the \"type\" of box and its \"location\" as surrogates for the more difficult conversation about what the box contains. Bricks and mortar or virtual become proxies for a weak understanding of the true professional learning context. (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 141)</p> <p>Fourth, when an expression of the learning context, technologies mediate action in ways that make it difficult and largely unproductive to sort out or separate the role of the technology from the actor and the professional context (Latour, 1994). In this contextual interaction, attention is removed from the univariate and discrete contribution of context, actor and technology to a more powerful focus on the interaction among all three. The physician does not focus on the characteristics of the ultrasound machine as a thing (Verbeek 2006) or a tool but on the image and what it shows and means. Jane does not focus on the CL designer. She is focused on building a quality learning experience. The more the technology reflects and expresses an understanding of the professional context, the less likely it is to be of singular focus or attention. (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 142)</p> <p>In doing so, it exerts a virtual influence beyond that which occurs when using the system. \"As these systems become more incorporated into everyday academic practices, they will work to shape and even define teachers' imaginations, expectations and behaviours.

He simply assumes the data produced by the software reflects \"good learning and teaching\" as expressed in the Pre-contextual Grandbridge strategic plan and mission statement. If this is not the case, then the Vice-President (Academic), the Human Resource Division or someone else needs to address the issue. The CFO's assumptions reflect the way responsibility is partitioned in an organization that does not understand what learning and teaching means in a professionally controlled sense.

Unbundling presumes higher education learning and teaching to be a mature technology ready to move beyond a whole system architecture. The reality is that pre-contextual universities are yet to develop sufficient understanding of what learning and teaching means to build the foundational architecture for the kind of technology (Bain and Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 154)</p> <p>As we have seen throughout the book, it is not whether there is a lecture that is important but how a learning experience is designed and delivered to maximize student outcomes. The true value of preparation time is not about whether it happens but what transpires as a result. Imagine determining the productivity of a medical or legal practice by establishing whether patients or clients are seen, hours/appointments billed, and resources consumed, without knowing whether the use of time and consumption of resources results in the successful resolution of cases or whether patients regained their health. If a university wants to save money associated with the cost of lectures or any other learning and teaching element, it has no standards, no term of reference to make those decisions beyond looking at others doing the same thing. This absence of understanding about efficacy and quality, while acknowledged is simply accepted as the normative state of affairs in pre-contextual productivity modelling in higher education (Sullivan et al. 2012).

Instead, pointing to research (Dobrescu et al, 2021) that found modifications to the cultural context in NAPLAN tests reduced gaps by 33% (rural-urban) and 50% (Indigenous students). However, recent reforms make it more difficult to make these changes</p> <p>Before the Gonski reforms, Australia had specific programs that helped teachers make their teaching material more relevant to rural students. These were removed for a more explicit one-size-fits-all model. We know that students learn by first connecting new concepts to their experience, but under the current model the opportunity to do this is actively removed. When teachers\u2019 work is reduced to dishing out pre-prescribed materials and focused on narrow measures, it is no wonder that we have a staffing shortage. We are actively de-professionalising the very people we need to turn things around</p> <p>Increasing cash bonuses, rental subsidies and transfer rights to teachers cannot overcome the persistent undermining of their professional work. Indeed, the most common sentiment I hear from rural teachers is that they are too busy to teach, to make the curriculum meaningful for their students and to build the very relationships that motivated them to enter the classroom in the first place.</p> <p>The education system likes to ignore that rural Australia exists as a distinct space with distinct cultures, knowledges and histories.

These systems are weakly integrated with an institution\u2019s decisions on resource allocation and longer term strategic planning.....The CNAA-derived systems employed by most universities were designed for the purpose of securing accountability of (and within) institutions that were, at that time, working in more stable environments. Today, when the agility of institutions is at a premium, they seem unhelpfully dirigiste and burdensome. The second respect in which conventional systems are \u2018self-defeating\u2019 is their tendency to promote an \u2018unintelligent accountability\u2019 (O\u2019Neill, 2002). Institutions respond to external requirements by strengthening their arrangements for internal accountability; managerial approaches to accountability, based on a lack of trust, undermine the professional commitment and motivation of academic staff; resources and effort are diverted from the core activities of teaching and research; and thus the effort to assure quality impedes its enhancement. Many commentators take it as axiomatic that there is, at best, a tension between enhancement and innovation on the one hand, and accountability-driven quality assurance on the other. Their work builds a stack of imposing dichotomies which contrast managerialism with collegial participation, conservation with change, risk- aversion with risk-taking, compliance with self-determination, and retrospective with prospective approaches to quality management (Biggs, 2002; Jackson, 2002; Newton, 2002; Matthias, 2003; Wright, 2003).

Players select cards by clicking on an individual card in the available cards section. </p> <p>When a player clicks on an individual card, the game will complete the following: 1. Check if current player's score and the numeric value of the selected card will add up to more than 15. If it does the card should not be selected and the player should be prompted through an alert to select another card. 2. Modify the available cards section by turning the selected card over. Do this by changing the selected card's display to the back of a card. 4. Visually add the selected card to the selected cards section of the relevant player. 5. Add the numeric value of the selected card to the score of the relevant player.  6. Check if current player's score equals 15 and the current player has 3 cards.

Many people who work in the edtech area do not earn their living in that way and they have to engage in various forms of action, and that action is very constrained by the politics, the economics, etc.  of the circumstances in which they're operating. And so, the question for me then is to what extent can a critical perspective, disposition or midset, become a resource for action in those constrained circumstances and it seems to me that part of the answer is to develop an ability to understand what the scope for action is in a specific set of circumstances so that one can ask questions about what is doable amongst a range of things that might be doable and what action one might then take. And I think that gels with your notion of being modest about the effects that we can have and not trying to be revolutionary and change all the world.

It has to be orchestrated with other technologies (including pedagogy) to be useful. Perhaps it's not the LMS that needs to be standardised but the methods used to create and share orchestrations(assemblages)</p> <p>\u201cYet at the same time, this routinisation presents a risk: when organisations are guided by old knowledge, they do not create new knowledge, unless special (and by definition, inefficient) efforts are made to understand gaps between standardised processes and the context in which they are deployed (Hunte, 2010).\u201d (Wears, 2015, p. 3)</p> <p>\u201cMany calls for standardisation in health care lack specificity and have an almost magical, \u201cwishful thinking\u201d quality (see Section 2.3), as if standardisation were some universal good in itself.\u201d (Wears, 2015, p. 3) Perhaps touching on the reusability paradox?</p> <p>\u201cDiscussions of standardisation could be improved by increasing their specificity in all these areas.\u201d (Wears, 2015, p. 3)</p> <p>\u201cWe have standardised roads, but not standardised travel paths; standardised grammars but not standardised stories, standardized instruments, notes and scales, but not standardised music\u201d (Wears, 2015, p. 3)</p> <p>\u201cThus, by limiting one\u2019s vision only to the dimension of data, the standardisation already present is missed\u201d (Wears, 2015, p. 4)</p> <p>\u201cThis is exacerbated by the problem that this standardisation tends to have arisen \u201cbottom-up\u201d, organically and emergently from the work context, rather than being engineered \u201ctop down\u201d by managers\u201d (Wears, 2015, p. 4)</p> <p>\u201cStandardisation is inextricably associated with the industrial revolution, Taylorism and ultimately the rationalism of the Enlightenment (Berg, 1997b).\u201d (Wears, 2015, p. 4)</p> <p>\u201cIts philosophical underpinnings in a Newtonian-Cartesian understanding of the world as a complicated, but ultimately decomposable, understandable and linearly predictable domain are seldom examined by its proponents, who generally show little awareness of even the possibility of other philosophical stances (Dekker, 2010; Dekker, et al., 2011; Dekker &amp; Nyce, 2012; Dekker, Nyce, van Winsen, &amp; Henriqson, 2010; Kneebone, 2002; Wears &amp; Kneebone, 2012; Xiao &amp; Vicente, 2000)\u201d (Wears, 2015, p. 4)</p> <p>\u201cClinical work systems have many of the characteristics of complex, self-organizing systems: they are comprised of a large number of mutually interacting elements, with multiple enhancing and inhibiting feedback loops; they are open to the environment, and their boundaries are hard to define; they operate far from equilibrium; they are path dependent (ie, their past is partly responsible for their present behaviour); their structure does not come from a priori designs, and it changes dynamically to adapt to changes in their environments (Cilliers, 1998)\u201d (Wears, 2015, p. 4)</p> <p>\u201cit is important to note that \u201cside effects are not a feature of reality, but a sign that our understanding of the system is narrow and flawed\u201d (Sterman, 2000\u201d (Wears, 2015, p. 4)</p> <p>\u201cAt its worst, this sort of standardisation becomes the \u2018arrogance of design\u2019, a privileging of the ex ante judgment of remote designers over that of the worker situated in a specific context (Bisantz &amp; Wears, 2008).\u201d (Wears, 2015, p. 4)</p> <p>\u201cIt is about phron\u0113sis rather than techne (Greenhalgh &amp; Wong, 2011; Hunte, 2010); practice rather than prescription.\u201d (Wears, 2015, p. 4)</p> <p>\u201cThus at least some of the resistance of frontline workers to standardisation is explicable, because the\u201d (Wears, 2015, p. 4)</p> <p>\u201cmodels of work inscribed in standardised routines clash to strongly with their actual work\u201d (Wears, 2015, p. 5) Getting at the potential value of lightweight development that emerges out of contextual needs and response to local requirements.</p> <p>\u201cRather than having to deal with the uncomfortable reality of a world full of risk, ambiguity, chance, and disorder, the rationalist model underlying standardisation offers clear, explicable, understandable explanations\u201d (Wears, 2015, p. 5)</p> <p>\u201c; the linearizing orderliness of standardization provides a bulwark against the unpleasant realities, and holds forth the reassuring prospect of control (Dekker, Nyce, &amp; Myers, 2012).\u201d (Wears, 2015, p. 5)</p> <p>\u201cThe artefacts are not occasioned to afford the emergence of new tasks, but to \u2019standardize\u2019 already existing ones. They are not allowed to potentialize anything: in a misplaced equation of \u2019standardization\u2019 with \u2019quality\u2019\u201d (Wears, 2015, p. 5)</p> <p>\u201cGiven its roots in Taylorism and the rationalism of the Enlightenment, it is not surprising that standardisation often depicted as a technical, politically neutral exercise; one best performed by experts, not involving negotiations, socio-political considerations, and certainly not involving winners or losers.\u201d (Wears, 2015, p. 5)</p> <p>\u201cstandardisation efforts are not neutral activities; they privilege one view of the world over another and so often one group over another.\u201d (Wears, 2015, p. 5)</p> <p>\u201cFor example, standardisation tends to elevate the role of the managers and technocrats, who organize and plan the work, over that of front-line workers, who merely execute their instructions (Kanigel, 1997)\u201d (Wears, 2015, p. 6)</p> <p>\u201cIt makes invisible the articulation work of those who fill the gaps between prescriptive standards and the messy uncertainties of real work (Nemeth, Wears, Woods, Hollnagel, &amp; Cook, 2008).\u201d (Wears, 2015, p. 6)</p> <p>\u201cFinally, standardisation assumes that heterogeneity and variation are inherently undesirable properties that should be eliminated, or at the least, nuisances to be minimized.\u201d (Wears, 2015, p. 6)</p> <p>\u201cthe law-of-requisite-variety Law of Requisite Variety (Ashby, 1957, 1958) (that every controller of a system must exhibit at least as much variety in behaviour as the system under its control); the principle of equifinality (that there may be many, equally good paths to a goal); and the principle of multifinality (that similar initial conditions may result in dramatically different final states)\u201d (Wears, 2015, p. 6)</p> <p>\u201cIn health care settings, standardisation presumes that average results will be equally obtainable by everyone despite individual differences, but this is hardly ever the case\u201d (Wears, 2015, p. 6)</p> <p>\u201cFinally, there is another form of heterogeneity \u2013 change over time \u2013 that poses a peculiar challenge to standardisation efforts.\u201d (Wears, 2015, p. 6)</p> <p>\u201cJust as unthinking application of standardisation as an improvement strategy results in the sort of problems outlined above, fairness demands that we admit that unthinking opposition to standardisation raises issues of its own\u201d (Wears, 2015, p. 6)</p> <p>\u201cClaims of special knowledge and corresponding immunity to standardisation can be self-interested.\u201d (Wears, 2015, p. 6)</p> <p>\u201cFor example, situations in which exceptional cases are commonplace and in which solutions are poorly understood or identifiable via analysis are poor candidates for standardisation, and are best left to discretionary control.\u201d (Wears, 2015, p. 7)</p>"},{"location":"sense/Society/stem-crisis.html","title":"STEM Crisis","text":"<p>See also: society, stem</p> <p>source</p> <p>We needed students in science and math.

Accordingly, this instrument comprises scales corresponding to the different stages of the self-regulation cycle, including variables on metacognition (e.g., \"I think about how to proceed when preparing for class.\") but also on motivation (e.g., goal setting, e.g., \"For the preparation of my course, I set myself the following goal:\") or emotion (e.g., affect, e.g., \"Right now, I feel active.\").

Any problem \u2013 like teaching \u2013 that involves a diverse group of people in activity that requires a change of behaviour or understanding is likely to be a wicked problem. Connectivism uses the metaphor of a network with nodes and connections as a central metaphor. Within this metaphor learning is a process that results in the modification of networks and the development of a network.</p> <p>Flowing from this foundation is the belief that teaching is best seen as an on-going process of reflective practice and action research exploring the differing perspectives of all those involved in learning and teaching.

Human beings tend to use objects in \u201cways suggested by the most salient perceived affordances, not in ways that are difficult to discover\u201d (Norman, 1993, p. 106). The nature of such affordances are not inherent to the artefact, but are instead co-determined by the properties of the artefact in relation to the properties of the individual, including the goals of that individual (Young, Barab, &amp; Garrett, 2000).

Beyond the systems, there is a need for the information being captured to change.

Bollier and Firestone (2010) observe that once \u201cpeople know there is an automated system in place, they may deliberately try to game it\u201d (p. 6).

The first found that gender stereotypes are negatively affecting girls\u2019 math grades and positively affecting boys\u2019. The second revealed how disproportionately penalized young black girls are for being assertive in classroom settings. Together, they make the clearest possible case for making it mandatory for teachers to be trained in spotting and striving to overcome their implicit biases.</p> <p>The findings of the first study reveal both the short and long-term effects of primary school teachers\u2019 implicit beliefs about gender on children\u2019s math skills and ambitions. Researchers found that girls often score higher than boys on name-blind math tests, but once presented with recognizable boy and girl names on the same tests, teachers award higher scores to boys. The long-term effects are amplified by socioeconomic factors and family structure\u2014girls from families where fathers were better educated than mothers and who are from lower socioeconomic communities were the most negatively affected.</p> <p>The impact of unconscious teacher bias is long understood and well-documented. This new research confirms decades of work done by Myra and David Sadker and Karen R. Zittleman. Through thousands of hours of classroom observations, the Sadkers and Zittleman identified specific ways in which implicit and stereotypical ideas about gender govern classroom dynamics. They, as others have, found that teachers spend up to two thirds of their time talking to male students; they also are more likely to interrupt girls but allow boys to talk over them. Teachers also tend to acknowledge girls but praise and encourage boys. They spend more time prompting boys to seek deeper answers while rewarding girls for being quiet. Boys are also more frequently called to the front of the class for demonstrations. When teachers ask questions, they direct their gaze towards boys more often, especially when the questions are open-ended. Biases such as these are at the root of why the United States has one of the world\u2019s largest gender gaps in math and science performance. Until they view their videotaped interactions, teachers believe they are being balanced in their exchanges.</p> <p>The two reports released last week were focused on girls. However, the same biases have been implicated in teachers unconsciously undermining boys\u2019 interest in the arts and language, enabling harmful gender gaps in self-regulation, and tacitly accepting certain male students\u2019 propensity to believe that studying is \u201cfor girls\u201d \u2013 all factors that contribute to boys\u2019 lower academic performance. An understanding of implicit bias, coupled with data analysis, shows the degree to which what is typically portrayed as a \u201cboy crisis\u201d in education is actually more a crisis of income disparity and related to class-based constructions of masculinity. However, while boys lives are impoverished in these ways, boys within each racial/class category benefit overall from beliefs that institutionalize \u201cboys being boys\u201d attitudes, a problem directly related to the second report released last week.</p> <p>The report, which included data on black girls\u2019 heightened vulnerability and overpolicing, showed extraordinarily high rates of school suspension for African American girls in New York, where Black girls are twelve times more likely than their white counterparts to be suspended. In Boston, eleven Black girls face suspension for every white girl that does. U.S. government surveys show that while Black children make up less than 20% of preschoolers, they make up more than half of out-of-school suspensions. Black boys have the highest rates of suspension overall, but nationally up to 12% of black girls are suspended annually. This is twice the rate of suspension of white boys. In effect, teacher biases are resulting in black girls being disproportionately punished for behavior that boys-crisis-in-education advocates want schools to accommodate by becoming more \u201cboy friendly.\u201d In the words of researcher Megan McClelland, \u201cIn general, there is more tolerance for active play in boys than in girls. Girls are expected to be quiet and not make a fuss. This expectation may be coloring some teachers\u2019 perceptions.\u201d</p> <p>Teacher (and parent) biases regarding science and math reflect the profound degree to which the \u201ctarget student\u201d implicitly remains white, male and of higher social status. Last year, rates of girls taking STEM-related advanced placement tests reached a record low. In two states not a single girl (in some states there were also no boys of color) took the Computer Science AP. Parental and teacher biases are the root cause of the systemic inhibition of diversity in the tech pipeline that we face today. Our two-decade long flat lining of girls\u2019 STEM participation will affect sex-segregated wage and wealth gaps for years to come. If we want to disrupt this reality, we need to understand why, by the time American girls reach the age of 10, simply checking off a \u201cfemale\u201d box at the top of a test results in lower test scores. For girls of color, gender and race create a double jeopardy stereotype threat. If anything at all is evident from studies of classroom interactions it is how dynamic the interplay between gender, race, ethnicity and social class are.</p> <p>The issue of whose assertive qualities, self-expression, and imagination are being cultivated and whose are being penalized speaks directly to the broader harms of not taking a nuanced intersectional approach to the problem of education. Everyone\u2019s lives are impoverished by these bias and the stereotype threats they cultivate in children. When we tackle the ugly sexism of the tech industry, try to understand why young boys are killing themselves, or contemplate the aggrieved racialized and gendered entitlement at the heart of so much of our violence, we are fighting rear-guard actions. It\u2019s too little, too late. Very little of this is done with malicious forethought. Training teachers to understand bias will not eliminate it, but it could create an institutional environment in which it is clear that understanding bias and its effects is critically important. The long-term return on investment is inestimable.</p> <p>Contact us at letters@time.com.</p> <p>Clipped on Wednesday, May 10, 2023 at 1:22 PM</p>"},{"location":"sense/Teaching/ungrading.html","title":"Ungrading","text":""},{"location":"sense/Teaching/ungrading.html#ungrading","title":"Ungrading","text":"<p>See also: teaching</p> <ul> <li>stommel-ungrading</li> </ul>"},{"location":"sense/Teaching/worked-examples.html","title":"Worked examples","text":"<p>See also: teaching, teaching-mathematics, teaching-digital-technologies</p> <p>Worked examples (Eiriksdottir &amp; Catrambone, 2011) </p> <ul> <li>typically associated with well-structured domains; and</li> <li>consist of a problem statement, one or more solution steps, and the final solution to the problem.</li> <li>illustrate how a domain problem is solved through a sequence of steps/statements without explanation why these actions are performed</li> </ul> <p>Main advantage is that worked examples reduce cognitive load.

Empirical tests have found that students completing minute papers scored higher than those who did not (Murphy &amp; Wolff, 2005). For academic staff, minute papers raise the awareness of student experience and misunderstandings and provide an opportunity to reflect on teaching. Also it is a mechanism through which the academic demonstrates respect for and interest in student opinion and encourages the student\u2019s active involvement in the learning process (Angelo &amp; Cross, 1993). Unlike other forms of course evaluation the minute paper can be explained to students as a vehicle for improving their own on-going instruction rather that that of future students (Chizmar &amp; Ostrosky, 1998).</p> <p>If minute papers are overused or poorly used it can be seen by students as a gimmick or pro forma exercise in polling (Angelo &amp; Cross, 1993). Murphy and Wolf (2005) found that as the semester progressed a few students became \u201cbored\u201d with the minute papers and gave rushed and trivial responses to the questions. It is difficult to prepare questions that can be easily understood and quickly answered (Angelo &amp; Cross, 1993). Implementing the one-minute paper in an online form did not achieve the same response rate as a paper-based version but was superior in that students provided longer responses, provided the instructor with greater flexibility with replies and were automatically archived for future use (Murphy &amp; Wolff, 2005).</p> <p>## References</p> <p>Angelo, T. and K.

Performance assessment is an example of authentic assessment, and as a result the characteristics of authentic assessment described in Table 3 can be applied to performance assessment. Eisner (1999, p. 659) suggests that performance assessment \u201cis the most important development in evaluation since the invention of the short-answer test and its extensive use during World War 1\u201d.</p> <p>Performance assessment can also be seen as:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Assessing process and product.</p> <p>Rather than simply examining the quality of an end product, performance assessment can also be used to evaluate student engagement during the process of creation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ill-suited, or even incapable, of fulfilling the comparative or accountability function required by many assessment stakeholders.</p> <p>Performance assessment tends to focus on the assessment of the individual and consequently may not provide information about a class or school useful for comparison against other cohorts (Eisner, 1999). The increase in validity offered by authentic assessment comes with the cost of decreased reliability (Montgomery, 2002, p. 36). Performance-based tests do not generalise well across tasks or situations (Swanson et al., 1995, p. 11).</p> </li> <li> <p>Creating uncertainty and difficulty.</p> <p>A simple example of the uncertainty and difficulty created are the problems faced by authors (e.g. Brady &amp; Kennedy, 2009; Eisner, 1999) in trying to define performance assessment. Getting acceptance of performance assessment from all stakeholders in the assessment activity \u2013 especially those interested in assessment for accountability and comparison purposes \u2013 is made more difficult if there isn\u2019t a widely accepted definition. Lesh and Lamon (1994, p. 3) offer another perspective when they describe how for mathematics educators it is easier to define \u201cwhat we want to move away from\u201d (test-based assessment) and ask questions such as what is meant by real-life situations, authentic mathematics, or performance activities.</p> </li> <li> <p>Difficult and potentially increase teacher workload.</p> <p>The use of authentic assessment tasks \u2013 perhaps requiring a unique task for each student - and effectively observing student performance of those tasks are likely to have a significant workload implication for teachers. Especially when teachers are new to the concept and practice of performance assessment. Difficulty and workload issues may be one explanation for the observation by Cumming and Maxwell (1999, p. 188) that attempts at authentic tasks account to little more than a gloss over the top of existing assessment practices.</p> </li> <li> <p>Increasing workload and possibly inequitable for students.</p> <p>Montgomery (2002, p. 36) suggests that two of the concerns around authentic assessment include the limited experience and skills some students have with authentic assessment, and how the increased linguistic complexity of some authentic assessment examples may result in equity issues.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Swanson, Norman and Linn (1995) present eight lessons learned from a long history of using performance-based assessment in medicine, these lessons are:</p> <ol> <li>The fact that examinees are tested in realistic performance situations does not make test design and domain sampling simple and straightforward. Sampling must consider both context (situation/task) and construct (knowledge/skill) dimensions and complex interactions are present between these dimensions </li> <li>No matter how realistic a performance-based assessment is, it is still a simulation, and examinees do not behave in the same way they would in real life.</li> <li>While high-fidelity performance-based assessment methods often yield rich and interesting examinee behaviour, scoring that rich and interesting behaviour can be problematic.</li> <li>Regardless of the assessment method used, performance in one context, does not predict performance in other contexts very well.</li> <li>Correlational studies of the relationships between performance-based test scores and other assessment methods targeting different skills typically produce variable and uninterpretable results.</li> <li>Because performance-based assessment methods are often complex to administer, multiple test forms and test administrators are required to test large numbers of examinees.</li> <li>All high-stakes assessments, regardless of the method used, have an unpredictable impact on teaching and learning.</li> <li>Neither traditional testing nor performance-based assessment methods are a panacea.

Numbers have wide ranging application and specific uses in counting, measuring and other means of quantifying situations and objects. Number systems are constructed to deal with different contexts and problems involving finite and infinite, discrete and continuous sets. Developing number sense and the ability to work effectively with numbers is critical to being an active and productive citizen who is successful at work and in future learning, who is financially literate, and who engages with the world and other individuals. algebra-v9 develops ways of using symbols and symbolic representations to think and reason about relationships in both mathematical and real-world contexts. It provides a means for manipulating mathematical objects, recognising patterns and structures, making connections, understanding properties of operations and the concept of equivalence, abstracting information, working with variables, solving equations and generalising number and operation facts and relationships. Algebra connects symbolic, graphic and numeric representations. It deals with situations of generality, communicating abstract ideas applied in areas such as science, health, finance, sports, engineering, and building and construction. measurement-v9 develops ways of quantifying aspects of the human and physical world. Measures and units are defined and selected to be relevant and appropriate to the context. Measurement is used to answer questions, show results, demonstrate value, justify allocation of resources, evaluate performance, identify opportunities for improvement and manage results. Measurement underpins understanding, comparison and decision-making in many personal, societal, environmental, agricultural, industrial, health and economic contexts. space-v9 develops ways of visualising, representing and working with the location, direction, shape, placement, proximity and transformation of objects at macro, local and micro scales in natural and constructed worlds. It underpins the capacity to make pictures, diagrams, maps, projections, networks, models and graphics that enable the manipulation and analysis of shapes and objects through actions and the senses. This includes notions such as surface, region, boundary, curve, object, dimension, connectedness, symmetry, direction, congruence and similarity. These notions apply to art, design, architecture, planning, transportation, construction and manufacturing, physics, engineering, chemistry, biology and medicine. statistics-v9 develops ways of collecting understanding and describing data and its distribution. Statistics provide a story, or means to support or question an argument, and enables exploratory data analysis that underpins decision-making and informed judgement. Statistical literacy requires an understanding of statistical information and processes, including an awareness of data and the ability to estimate, interpret, evaluate and communicate with respect to variation in the real world. Statistical literacy provides a basis for critical scrutiny of an argument, the accuracy of representations, and the validity and reliability of inferences and claims. The effective use of data requires acknowledging and expecting variation in the collection, analysis and interpretation of categorical and numerical variables. Statistics is used in business, government, research, sport, healthcare and media for critical and informed evaluation of issues, arguments and decision-making. probability-v9 strand develops ways of dealing with uncertainty and expectation, making predictions, and characterising the chance of events, or how likely events are to occur from both empirical and theoretical bases. It provides a means of considering, analysing and utilising the chance of events, and recognising random phenomena for which it is impossible to exactly determine the next observed outcome before it occurs. In contexts where chance plays a role, probability provides experimental and theoretical ways to quantify how likely it is that a particular outcome will occur or a proposition is the case. This enables students to understand contexts involving chance and to build mathematical models surrounding risk and decision-making in a range of areas of human endeavour. These include finance, science, business management, epidemiology, games of chance, computer science and artificial intelligence."},{"location":"sense/Teaching/Curriculum/v9-oz-mathematics-learning-area.html#about","title":"About","text":"<p>Understand this learning area</p>"},{"location":"sense/Teaching/Curriculum/v9-oz-mathematics-learning-area.html#revisions---84-to-9","title":"Revisions - 8.4 to 9","text":"<p>Revisions</p> <ul> <li>Interest in PISA performance a consideration - a reason for interest</li> <li>received greatest level of feedback</li> <li>STrong focus on \"students developing mastery in mathematics by becoming proficient with the essential mathematical facts, concepts, procedures and processes\"</li> <li>Since that mastery supports retention and transfer</li> </ul> <p>Key changes  - 6 strands: Number, Algebra, Measurement, Space, Statistics and Probability - More explicit acheivement standards - Increased importance on students learning how to apply mathematics to real world contexts: mathematical thinking, reasoning and problem solving process skills - opportunities to learn &amp; engage in mathematical modelling, computational thinking, statistical investigation, probability experiments and simulations - Increased links with numeracy general capability leading to new content: error &amp; approximation, 3D coordinate systems, logarithmic scales, solving exponential functions and interpreting networks - REduced content</p>"},{"location":"sense/Teaching/Curriculum/v9/v9-learning-areas.html","title":"Learning Areas","text":"<p>See also: australian-curriculum, teaching</p> About this page <p>The base information on this page is generated automatically from machine-readable versions of version 9 of the Australian Curriculum using this project </p> <p>In particular, it's an example of leveraging the reprogrammability of digital technologies to orchestrate (gather, weave and augment) a range of technologies (the Australian Curriculum, RDF, Python, Foam etc) for a very specific purpose.

(Boaler, 2015, p. 34)</p> <p>Successful math users have an approach to math, as well as mathematical understanding, that sets them apart from less successful users. They approach math with the desire to understand it and to think about it, and with the confidence that they can make sense of it. Successful math users search for patterns and relationships and think about connections. (Boaler, 2015, p. 34)</p> <p>When students see math as a series of short questions, they cannot see the role for their own inner growth and learning. They think that math is a fixed set of methods that either they get or they don't. (Boaler, 2015, p. 34)</p> <p>When students see math as a broad landscape of unexplored puzzles in which they can wander around, asking questions and thinking about relationships, they understand that their role is thinking, sense making, andgrowing.Whenstudentsseemathematicsasasetofideasandrelationshipsandtheirroleas one of thinking about the ideas, and making sense of them, they have a mathematical mindset. (Boaler, 2015, p. 34)</p> <p>So how do we develop mathematical mindsets in students so that they are willing to approach math with sense making and intuition? (Boaler, 2015, p. 35)</p> <p>Afterextensivestudyofthedifferentstrategies that the students used, the researchers concluded that the difference between high- and low-achieving students was not that the low-achieving students knew less mathematics, but that they were interacting with mathematics differently. (Boaler, 2015, p. 35)</p> <p>Instead of approaching numbers with flexibility and number sense, they seemed to cling to formal procedures they had learned, using them very precisely, not abandoning them even when it made sense to do so. The low achievers did not know less, they just did not use numbers flexibly---probably because they had been set on the wrong pathway, from an early age, of trying to memorize methods and number facts instead of interacting with numbers flexibly ( (Boaler, 2015, p. 35)</p> <p>Number sense reflects a deep understanding of mathematics, but it comes about through a mathematical mindset that is focused on making sense of numbers and quantities. It is useful to think about the ways number sense is developed in students, not only because number sense is the foundation for all higher level mathematics (Feikes &amp; Schwingendorf, 2008) but also because number sense and mathematical mindsets develop together, and learning about ways to develop one helps the development of the other. (Boaler, 2015, p. 36)</p> <p>Notably, the brain can only compress concepts; it cannot compress rules and methods. Therefore students who do not engage in conceptual thinking and instead approach mathematics as a list of rules to remember are not engaging in the critical process of compression, so their brain is unable to organize and file away ideas; instead, it struggles to hold onto long lists of methods and rules. (Boaler, 2015, p. 37)</p> <p>Math facts by themselves are a small part of mathematics, and they are best learned through the use of numbers in different ways and situations. Unfortunately, many classrooms focus on math facts in isolation, giving students the impression that math facts are the essence of mathematics, and, even worse, that mastering the fast recall of math facts is what it means to be a strong mathematicsstudent. (Boaler, 2015, p. 38)</p> <p>For about one-third of students, the onset of timed testing is the beginning of math anxiety (Boaler, 2014c). Sian Beilock and her colleagues have studied people's brains through MRI imaging and found that math facts are held in the working memory section of the brain. But when students are stressed, such as when they are taking math questions under time pressure, the working memory becomes blocked, and students cannot access math facts they know (Beilock, 2011). (Boaler, 2015, p. 38)</p> <p>We know that when learning happens a synapse fires, and in order for structural brain change to happen we need to revisit ideas and learn them deeply. But what does that mean? It is important to revisit mathematical ideas, but the \"practice\" of methods over and over again is unhelpful. (Boaler, 2015, p. 42)</p> <p>Most textbook authors in the United States base their whole approach on the idea of isolating methods, reducing them to their simplest form and practicing them. This is problematic for many reasons. First, practicing isolating methods induces boredom in students; many students simply turn off when they think their role is to passively accept a method (Boaler &amp; Greeno, 2000) and repeat it over and over again. Second, most practice examples give the most simplified and disconnected version of the method to be practiced, giving students no sense of when or how they might use the method. (Boaler, 2015, p. 42)</p> <p>When learning a definition, it is helpful to offer different examples---some of which barely meet the definition and some of which do not meet it at all---instead of perfect examples each time. Mathematics teachers should also think about the width and breadth of the definition they are showing, and sometimes this is best highlighted by non-examples. When learning a definition, it is often very helpful to see both examples that fit the definition and others that do not fit, rather than just presenting a series of perfect examples. For example, when learning about birds it can be helpful to think about bats and why they are not birds, rather than to see more and more examples of sparrows and crows. (Boaler, 2015, p. 45)</p> <p>The students who were taught to practice methods over and over in a disciplined school in which there were high levels of \"time on task\" scored at significantly lower levels on the national mathematics examination than students who practiced much less but were encouraged to think conceptually. One significant problem the students from the traditional school faced in the national examination---a set of procedural questions---was that they did not know which method to choose to answer questions. They had practiced methods over and over but had never been asked to consider a situation and choose a method. (Boaler, 2015, p. 45)</p> <p>The oversimplification of mathematics and the practice of methods through isolated simplified procedures is part of the reason we have widespread failure in the United States and the United Kingdom. It is also part of the reason that students do not develop mathematical mindsets; they do not see their role as thinking and sense making; rather, they see it as taking methods and repeating them. Students are led to think there is no place for thinking in math class.

High achieving students were found to have better number sense.</p> <p>Low achieving students with out the flexibly (mathematical-mindset) were relying on formal rules, beyond when it made sense to not use those rules. Consequently low achievers are given more drill and practice which is more likely to prevent the development of a mathematical-mindset</p> <p>The high-achieving students solved the questions by using what is known as number sense\u2014they interacted with the numbers flexibly and conceptually. The low-achieving students used no number sense and seemed to believe that their role was to recall and use a standard method even when this was difficult to do. For example, when students were given a problem such as 21 \u2013 6, the high-achieving students made the problem easier by changing it to 20 \u20135, but the low-achieving students counted backward, starting at 21 and counting down,which is difficult to do and prone to error.After extensive study of the different strategies that the students used, the researchers concluded that the difference between high- and low-achieving students was not that the low-achieving students knew less mathematics, but that they were interacting with mathematics differently. Instead of approaching numbers with flexibility and number sense, they seemed to cling to formal procedures they had learned, using them very precisely, not abandoning them even when it made sense to do so. The low achievers did not know less, they just did not use numbers flexibly\u2014probably because they had been set on the wrong pathway, from an early age, of trying to memorize methods and number facts instead of interacting with numbers flexibly (Boaler, 2015, pp. 35)</p>"},{"location":"sense/Teaching/Mathematics/number-sense.html#references","title":"References","text":"<p>Boaler, J.

<p>Australia's Chief Scientist Cathy Foley, a physicist, said throughout her career she has too often been the first or the only woman in the room.</p> <p>\"We're seeing lots of women in the life sciences \u2026 but what we're not seeing is those women actually being promoted and having secure long-term careers,\" Dr Foley said.</p> <p>\"In the physical sciences \u2026 we're just not attracting young women to see this as a pathway for them.</p> <p>\"There's a skills shortage, particularly with STEM-trained, skilled people, and so if we were able to get equal numbers of women into those roles, that would really be a first step in addressing those shortages.\"</p>"},{"location":"sense/Teaching/Mathematics/qld-girls-still-underrepresented.html#why-are-female-enrolments-lower","title":"Why are female enrolments lower?","text":"<p>Mr Marchant said one of the reasons female participation is lower was believed to be due to maths anxiety and lower confidence.</p> <p>\"There is some survey data which shows that by Year 8, 57 per cent of girls dislike mathematics compared to about 44 per cent of boys, and only 10 per cent of girls really like mathematics compared to 17 per cent of boys.</p> <p>\"So that two-to-one ratio is almost in place by year eight.\u00a0</p> <p>\"The interventions we need to put in place are probably about increasing girls' confidence in primary school about mathematics.\"</p> <p>Dr Foley said some of the contributing reasons included a national shortage of specialist maths and sciences teachers, as well as a lack of understanding among young people about the future job market.</p> <p>\"If you think about where we're seeing data and technologies, artificial intelligence, machine learning, becoming part of the everyday people having those sorts of skills are urgently needed, and we are not

The census is run every 5 years in Australia.\u00a0\u00a0 Dependent variable The dependent variable is the variable that depends on another value, for example, the distance travelled is dependent on the amount of time spent driving. Distribution A distribution refers to how often data values occur. Often the plot of the distribution reveals a characteristic shape e.g. data may be normally distributed, or positively skewed. \u00a0 Independent variable The independent variable is the variable that is manipulated in the experiment or data collection to investigate the effect on the dependent variable. For example, time is the independent variable when travelling. \u00a0 Measures of central tendency Measures of central tendency include the mean, median and mode. The mean (average) is found by adding all the data values and dividing by the number of values. The median is the middle value when all data values are listed in order.

Jump in\ud83d\udc47  </p> <p>Gaussian distribution is so prevalent, because it arises as a limit of averaging out many independent random variables with finite variance. This fundamental law of statistics is called a Central Limit Theorem or CLT. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_l\u2026 </p> <p>This can be very well seen in a little simulation below: 200x400 grid (so 80000) independent random variables with uniform distribution (-0.5,0.5) are simulated and a histogram of averages are taken and plotted below, clearly showing bell curve as expected.   </p> <p> </p> <p>So we are done now? What else is there to say? Well... there are two main assumptions of CLT. First that all individual variables have finite variance. And that is most of the time the case. But second that they are independent. And that is when things are a little complicated.</p> <p>Because when there is even tiny bit of dependence introduced in these variables, CLT falls apart. I simulate this below by adding a small bias to all the random cells, nothing even noticeable by eye. But suddenly the averages explode into the tail of distribution:   </p> <p> </p> <p>6 sigma, 10 sigma, 13 sigma these events should pretty much be impossible under normal distribution. A 10-Sigma would be an event that happens once every 5.249e+020 years (that's half a Septillion). But of course with slight dependence the mean of these vars is no longer Gaussian</p> <p>And that often happens in real world - here everything is pretty much always slightly dependent. But often that dependence is so weak, CLT still works, and statisticians are happy, models work, and everything is great. But every now and then things suddenly get dependent.</p> <p>E.g. in stock market, an index is a combination of individual stocks whose prices are mostly independent and so often behaves like a gaussian random walk. Until of course an event occurs that affects all these companies and suddenly they are dependent and you see a 10 sigma jump.</p> <p>This should be taught in every statistics class as literally the first thing after CLT. But often isn't. And hence people misuse statistics and apply wrong models to complex data.

Make reflection an integral part of your routine of planning, teaching and evaluation. Prioritise your commitments. Beginning teachers may be so preoccupied with the subject matter, or with their delivery of the lesson, that they have little time to consider how well it is going. Prepare thoroughly so that you are confident of your knowledge and clear about the structure of your lesson. Use a clear lesson plan to guide your teaching. Beginning teachers may be reluctant to be self-critical at a time when they are lacking in self-confidence and when they are fearful of failure and their vulnerability. Don't expect to be perfect, but do acknowledge that you need to improve. Deliberately try to learn from your mistakes. Beginning teachers may lack the knowledge of diverse teaching strategies that might help them to perceive alternatives to their current practice. Study chapters 6 to 14. Talk to other teachers about how they teach. Ask for advice. Observe other teachers. Look for ideas on the Internet. Be prepared to take a risk and step outside your comfort zone. Inexperienced teachers may have a very limited number of 'frames' within which to consider their teaching. Practise deliberately looking at situations from more than one perspective. Try to look at your teaching through the eyes of your students. Take Edward de Bono's advice and change 'thinking hats'. Some beginning teachers are unable to achieve the detachment from their own practice that would enable them to reflect on it objectively and critically. Get feedback from your students. Ask colleagues to observe your teaching and give you feedback. Establish a reflective partnership. Beginning teachers may see each class and each student as unique and therefore see limited potential in reflection on practice. Look beyond the uniqueness of each student and lesson and try to identify the common elements that help or hinder student learning in your classes. Beginning teachers may feel that they have no control over the social, moral and political issues that impinge on their classrooms. You may not be able to change these issues, but you can at least discuss them with other teachers and develop ways of controlling their influence on your teaching. The busy routines of teaching may make it difficult to develop a challenging and questioning perspective. Set aside time for reflection. Challenge yourself to question every major teaching decision you make. Many teacher education students want recipes to help them develop patterns of appropriate teacher behaviour (ways of dealing with everyday classroom events) so that they can react in fixed ways. Don't expect to always be able to deal with similar events in the same way. Be flexible. Deliberately try to develop your skills at reflecting-in-action. Teacher education students are often confused by the range of theoretical models of teaching and learning they are confronted with. Begin your reflections by adopting just one theoretical stance. Use that perspective to interpret what is happening, then adopt a different theoretical stance. Reflection is not a normal mode of behaviour for many people. Develop the habit of reflecting on everything that happens in your life. It is easy to confuse knowledge acquisition with reflection. The essence of reflection is not to discover something entirely new, but to come to a better understanding of something that is already familiar. Make this your goal."},{"location":"sense/Teaching/RTT/returning-to-the-profession.html#critical-reflection_1","title":"Critical reflection","text":"<ul> <li>writer was center of activity, examining the part they played</li> <li>multiple perspectives (and frames?)</li> <li>clear goal e.g. What?

While not specifically focused on recording behavioural incidents the study does resonate with my observations. One of the four themes arising from this work was the perceived limitations of how this data was generated and used. In particular, the nature of the digital technologies used for collecting and analysing data created issues such as:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Increased effort to recollect and record data.</p> <p>Systems for recording data are not sufficiently usable or integrated into everyday teaching practice to enable the efficient recording of data as it is generated. I've observed how this has made some teachers question if/how to record the data.</p> </li> <li> <p>Constrained by reductive or limited data structures.</p> <p>Digital systems for recording data are often designed to collect data that is easy to collect and analyse across an entire school system. Creating a tendency for data structures and interfaces that are generic and constrained. Making it difficult (more time consuming) to record meaningful contextual detail that extends outside that generic structure. It also leads to departments and schools developing personal workarounds to serve local needs. I've observed conversations between teachers talking through the local workarounds to a state-based system that has been accepted within the school.</p> </li> </ul> <p>As for improving these systems, Selwyn (2016) closes with a series of questions to be answered to achieve just that. In particular, asking what data, tools and techniques might enable more contextualised and meaningful data to be collected and used?

Subsequent experimentation was limited, but positive. Over time, slowly improvements were made.

Over the last 15 years or so - mirroring changes in broader society - the diversity of students' learning needs has been increasing beyond the narrow on-campus/distance distinction.</p> <p>In all the cases where we've been successful at catering for student diversity, the three key Universal Design for Learning guidelines have played a significant role.

The use of these devices can be a challenge - both practically and pedagogically. Reflect on your use of ICT in your teaching. Share a success story (it can be something very simple!). </p> <p>Unlike Carly, I'm not worried about my digital technology skills.  After all digital technologies is one of my teaching areas.  As I return to school, I'm more nervous about the limitations Ed Qld places on digital technologies. I've also spent the last 30 years using and helping others use digital technology to enhance/transform learning and teaching. Experience which reinforces the point made in the reading, attempts to use digital technologies will always face practical and pedagogical challenges. Experience which also suggests that even the simplest, contextually appropriate use of digital technologies can offer a pedagogical benefit. As well as minimising the challenges.</p> <p>For example, the following successful use of digital technologies is from the very first lesson I taught as a pre-service (aka student) teacher. Even with my knowledge and experience with digital technologies, I decided to go simple to minimise the challenges. The lesson was titled \"Timezones and Mass\". My mentor had established a routine of using an interactive white board and a set of slides to scaffold lessons. Mirroring his practice I designed a set of slides. The first slide of the timezones section contained an image of specific international locale and the question \"What time is it here, right now?\" (see below). When that slide appeared - as I hoped - a spark of recognition and conversation arose from one of the student tables. A spark I encouraged to spread to the rest of the class through questioning etc. </p> <p></p> <p>The image is of a part of Cape Town, South Africa including Table mountain. It was sourced via a Google image search specifically because I'd discovered that one of the students was originally from Cape Town. For him, this bit of mathematical knowledge was important and relevant. His experience established the relevance for the rest of the class and provided a source of confirmation for the calculations performed. At the same time, it was achieved using a very simple application digital technology that was known to work in this classroom and was in a pedagogical form that was common and consistent with the class's experience. This simplicity reduced my worry and cognitive load and allowed me to focus on other factors.</p> <p>For me this is a simple example of what Mishra and Koehler (2006) define \"quality teaching\" as leveraging an understanding of the relationships between technology, content, and pedagogy to \"develop appropriate, context-specific strategies and representations\" (p. 1029). Not fancy, or the latest technology. I'd never used the IWB or the associated software previously. To be frank the software was pretty bad. But given the context of my first lesson in someone else's classroom building effectively on what was there worked well.</p> <p>Aside: Given my disciplinary background I've never been a fan of terms like \"ICT\" and \"electronic technologies\". Largely because they hide the unique and powerful properties of digital technology - e.g. data homogenisation (convergence) and reprogrammability (generativity) (Yoo et al, 2012). If the goal is to use digital technologies as part of \"quality teaching\" then understanding the fundamental properties of digital technologies will be useful to understanding how to weave them into content and pedagogy in contextually appropriate ways.</p>"},{"location":"sense/Teaching/RTT/rtt-effective-teaching.html#references","title":"References","text":"<p>Mishra, P., &amp; Koehler, M.

Unfortunately these things seem to be in increasingly short supply for our students. I can recall many examples where I have been surprised by the lack of resilience shown by students who give up at the first opportunity.  Teaching involves challenging students to progress.... but how do we challenge and support learners at the same time?  Have you encountered emotionally fragile students? How have you supported them? </p> <p>Next year will be my first year of teaching. As a newly qualified teacher I do not have significant personal experience of supporting emotionally fragile students and certainly not recently. However, I have been lucky enough to spend a few days of observation at the school I'll be teaching at next year. Hence the following is an early description of what I've seen and what I'm planning, rather than what I've experienced.</p> <p>Observing classes in mathematics and digital technologies, it appeared that the many students were disengaged from learning. Motivation and drive were in short supply. If not being disruptive, students were left to their own devices (figuratively and literally). Not a lot of evidence of emotional fragility. Perhaps because the lack of engagement in learning meant no opportunity for students to be challenged. It was also evident that many of the lessons, especially in mathematics, were taking a more procedural, rather than conceptual, approach. Lessons that did but pose much in the way of conceptual, meaningful, or contextual challenges.</p> <p>The nascent plans I'm formulating are informed heavily by ideas from work on mathematical mindsets (Boaler, 2015), thinking classrooms (Liljedahl, 2020), and many other related ideas. Ideas that build on a constructivist foundation with a focus on students engaging with rich mathematical tasks through collaborative activities that enable and celebrate diversity and build growth/mathematical mindsets. Hopefully, the consequence of all this is students start building an interest and approach to learning that develops deep conceptual, disciplinary knowledge.</p> <p>Sounds great in theory, but practical implementation is a challenge. The associated literature emphasises that this does not happen over night. Even that most talented teacher could not implement over night, and even if they could the students would not be able to cope (Liljedahl, 2020). Hence the current plan is to take an on-going iterative approach that seeks to introduce different aspects of this practice in a way that keeps within the zone of proximal development of myself, the students, and the school. The broad plan at the moment, involves the following:</p> <ol> <li>Establish a different set of expectations around mathematical mindsets.</li> <li>Slowly introduce different activities that help build mathematical mindsets and students' self-concept and beliefs about self-efficacy (and slowly remove more explicit scaffolds).</li> <li>Engage in critical reflection about what works, what doesn't and then return to #2.</li> </ol> <p>The specifics will come next after I finish this course. A lot of the specifics will come as I learn more about the students and their specific needs.</p>"},{"location":"sense/Teaching/RTT/rtt-effective-teaching.html#references_1","title":"References","text":"<p>Boaler, J.

One of many different theories of learning. In turn constructivism comes in many often diverse, fragmented and sometimes incoherent flavours (Gordon, 2009). Constructivism sees learning as a process through which new knowledge is filtered through and connected (in)effectively with our pre-existing knowledge. The quality of this filtering and connection is reliant on the nature of the activities the individual learner performs. Goodyear (2005) positions constructivism (and similar theories of learning) as a pedagogical philosophy. The most fundamental of his levels of design for learning. It identifies specific beliefs about how people learn, without offering specific operational advice for design for learning. Echoing Dennick's (2016) suggestion that no connection necessarily exists between epistemology and pedagogy.  Consequently, I see constructivism fitting most explicitly with APST 1 - Know students and how they learn. In particular, Focus 1.2 - Understand how students learn. It provides a model for how learning happens.</p> <p>Constructivism does have implications of teaching and many of the other standards. But effective teaching (aka design for learning) must connect constructivism with other theories and models (many of the other APSTs) to meet the specific contextual need. Dennick (2016) suggests that \"there is no necessary connection between epistemology and pedagogy\" (p. 200) but argues that constructivism promises to provide some unity of practice for design for learning. Hence I see constructivism as an \"answer\" for APST 1.2 providing a strong informing voice for most of the remaining APSTs/the practice of design for learning.

Web Components are based on web standards and work in any environment that supports basic HTML and JavaScript. This means that there is no complex setup required for you to get started. Web Components align with the way that browsers have always worked, they are pretty low level and straightforward. For most projects you will still want to use libraries or frameworks. But instead of each framework developing their own component model, they can use the features that are already baked into the browser. Web components are quite flexible and have a multitude of possible use cases. The more prominent use case is to build reusable UI components.

Yet, the difficult and time-consuming task of using the RtDP in an indirect fashion acts as an important complication for users as less than a third of OSPs comply with GDPR\u2019s export requirements and 76.8% of OSPs do not offer any import possibilities (Syrmoudis et al. 2021).

These views suggest that contemporary work is primarily about gathering and weaving together disparate strands (of phenomena, knowledge, activity, etc). That in a world where (just about) everything is in a digital form a key mechanism for automating (efficiency) and augmenting (transformation) work is digital technology. However, there is growing recognition (e.g. RPA and heavy-and-light-weight development) that given the diversity and complexity of contemporary work that effective and efficient gathering and weaving can't just be done at the enterprise level. Suggesting there needs to be capacity for gathering and weaving at smaller levels, perhaps at an individual level.

The concept of Parsons Problems was introduced by Dr. Kate Sanders and Dr. Quintin Cutts in their 2008 paper titled \"Using Parsons Problems to Bootstrap Interest in Computer Programming.\"</p> <p>In Parsons Problems, learners are presented with a programming task that requires them to rearrange a set of provided code snippets to construct a correct program. The code snippets are pre-written and can include both correct and incorrect statements or lines of code. The goal of the exercise is for learners to arrange the code snippets in the correct order to solve the problem.</p> <p>The key idea behind Parsons Problems is that they focus on the structural aspects of programming rather than the syntactic details. By providing the code snippets, learners are relieved of the burden of remembering the exact syntax and can concentrate on understanding the logical flow and structure of the program. This approach helps beginners develop problem-solving skills and a better understanding of programming concepts without getting overwhelmed by syntax errors.</p> <p>Parsons Problems can be implemented using different formats. For example, the code snippets may be presented as blocks of text that learners need to reorder, or they can be provided as drag-and-drop elements that learners arrange in the correct sequence.

Originally, families were assigned an a-number and kept together. Trump's policy was to separate families. Requiring each family member to receive a separate a-number. The digital system was not designed to handle linking multiple a-numbers together. i.e. there was no way to track families. </p> <p>Pahlka </p> <p>But essentially, the way we think about software in government, it\u2019s a project. You start it. You finish it. And then there\u2019s a little bit of money trailing around for you to keep it up and running. So when you have a change like this, that\u2019s frankly incredibly urgent, you don\u2019t have people who work on that software day to day, week to week that are there ready to change it and know how the code base works.</p> <p>So in contrast, Google didn\u2019t create Search and then lay off 95 percent of the staff and keep just a skeleton crew around it to keep it up. The way things that really work in the real world are staffed is on an ongoing basis, not only to make sure that changes in some connecting database somewhere can be updated so the thing doesn\u2019t crash, but also because we live in a dynamic world. We can\u2019t expect there not to be policy changes that have to be incorporated.</p> <p>And frankly, we should be constantly looking at the software and saying, is it doing what it could be doing as well as it could? There\u2019s constant improvements in the consumer products that we use. So the curve of staffing in a consumer product is it starts really slow, and then as the product becomes more and more clearly valuable and popular, the staffing goes up and up and up. It\u2019s just this constant curve up. That\u2019s how the software is constantly better and more usable and more valuable to us.</p> <p>In government, it\u2019s this weird, like, there\u2019s nothing, then you hire all these people, and then there\u2019s this couple-year period where lots of people are working on it, and then it drops to almost zero. So after almost zero, you have no capability to change that software.

I wonder about the idea of \"innate\" schemas</li> <li>There are schemas of objects (e.g., a CHAIR schema), of persons (e.g., a TEACHER schema), of a state of affairs (e.g., a PEACE schema), of abstract concepts (e.g., a COMMUNISM schema), of relationships between objects (e.g., a RELATION: CHAIR-TABLE schema), etc. Schemas of actions and events are often labeled as scripts, a metaphorical use of the corresponding cinematic term. Furthermore, a distinction has been made between situational schemas (= \u201cframes\u201d), action schemas (= \u201cplans\u201d), and \u201cgrammars,\u201d which represent the regular structure of narratives and stories (Mandler 1984).</li> <li>Schemas are not direct, image-like copies of phenomena in the external world but the result of cognitive processing of information. The mind neither copies the world, passively accepting it as a readymade given, nor does it ignore the world.</li> <li>Schemas have different levels of complexity and abstraction. One can have an abstract schema CHAIR as well as a concrete schema of one specific chair, for example, in a particular dining room.</li> <li>Schemas have variables which can take on various values. The elements that make up a schema can be called slots. Any important element or schema within a schema may be thought of as a slot that can accept any of the range of values that are compatible with its associated schemata. For example, a very general schema for BUY may have four fairly abstract slots: a seller, a buyer, an object, and money. On different occasions these slots in the BUY schema will be filled differently.

Prisons are first and foremost not houses of confinement but departments of correction. The crucial part of this institution is not the cage of the prison cell, but the routine of the timetables that govern the daily lives of prisoners.

Only by analysing power in its multiplicity, as Foucault did, do we have a chance to mount a multiplicity of freedoms that would counter all the different ways in which power comes to define the limits of who we can be. source The irony of a philosophy that would define power once and for all is that it would thereby delimit the essence of freedom. Such a philosophy would make freedom absolutely unfree. Those who fear freedom\u2019s unpredictability find Foucault too risky. But those who are unwilling to decide today what might begin to count as freedom tomorrow find Foucault, at least with respect to our philosophical perspectives, freeing.

The (heavyweight) IT department decides over and prioritizes lightweight IT initiatives. This ensures a focus on integration and security, but constrains innovation [17]. </li> <li>Bimodal IT Model: Following Gartner\u2019s notion a separate IT department is installed for lightweight IT. Heavyweight standards are enforced as soon as solutions are set into production, which can lead to the heavyweight IT departments resources being the constraining factor for innovation. This idea was for example discussed by Urbach and Ahlemann [41], who recommend a systematic separation of backend- and frontend development, because the later tends to be lightweight and thus demands for a more agile and user centric development approach. But they consider this as a transitionary solution. As no part of the organizations of the future is going to remain untouched from digitalization, they foresee a much closer integration of business and IT departments [41]. They assume that the organizational boundaries between business and IT might not remain as separate organizations: Application-related IT experts will work directly together with users in the specialist areas, which will lead to interdisciplinary teams [35]. This model is also favored in the context of modern IT Service Management (ITSM) to allow for digitalization [21]. The practical value of this approach was proven in the context of the Digital Renewal mega-program in the Norwegian healthcare sector where a special unit was able to start several lightweight projects and infuse innovation into the large-scale integration and standardization effort. Further research also highlighted the innovation discourse in such mega-programs [28, 29]. </li> <li>Laissez-fair Model: Lightweight solutions are allowed to be developed as standalone solutions with the support of vendors or the heavyweight IT department. This optimally uses knowledge, abilities and monetary resources in the business for innovation, but can have drawbacks regarding security and scalability [17]</li> <li>Platform Model: The heavyweight solution becomes a platform for the lightweight solutions, which are typically integrated via application program interfaces (APIs). Several publications looked at the lightweight IT concept in this context ranging over different topics: The modular implementation of lightweight IT to be used to compliment a core infrastructure, which is grown as an extension of the existing base and designed and developed over its whole life cycle, [7] the usefulness of the concept in context of a new innovative development approach for applications on digital platforms, [20] its part in a platformization process [39] and its potential regarding platforms that embrace end-user IT development to enable Shadow IT becoming overt business IT [7].</li> </ul>"},{"location":"sense/nodt/heavy-and-light-weight.html#drivers","title":"Drivers","text":"<p>User needs are mentioned as the main driver of lightweight IT across publications (p. 563) enabled by IT consumerisation and expert users</p>"},{"location":"sense/nodt/heavy-and-light-weight.html#benefits-and-corresponding-risks","title":"Benefits and corresponding risks","text":"<ul> <li> <p>User focus, satisfaction improvement and lack of scalability </p> <p>The lack of scalability mentioned here is handling additional users.</p> </li> <li> <p>Low costs, easy to implement &amp; support complexity</p> <p>Mentions low cost development and less training due to the \"intuitive design and workflow focus\".

Yet when forecasters are deciding whether to use a human forecaster or a statistical algorithm, they often choose the human forecaster. This phenomenon, which we call algorithm aversion, is costly, and it is important to understand its causes. In Chapter 1, we show that people are especially averse to algorithmic forecasters after seeing them perform, even when they see them outperform a human forecaster. This is because people more quickly lose confidence in algorithmic than human forecasters after seeing them make the same mistake. In Chapter 2, we investigate how aversion to imperfect algorithms might be overcome. We find that people are considerably more likely to choose to use an imperfect algorithm, and thus perform better, when they can modify its forecasts.

But for those who are excessively nervous about the new millennium, I can provide, right at the start, some good advice about how to confront it. \u2026. Here is what Henry David Thoreau told us: \u201cAll our inventions are but improved means to an unimproved end.\u201d Here is what Goethe told us: \u201cOne should, each day, try to hear a little song, read a good poem, see a fine picture, and, if possible, speak a few reasonable words.\u201d Socrates told us: \u201cThe unexamined life is not worth living.\u201d Rabbi Hillel told us: \u201cWhat is hateful to thee, do not do to another.\u201d And here is the prophet Micah: \u201cWhat does the Lord require of thee but to do justly, to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy God.\u201d And I could say, if we had the time, (although you know it well enough) what Jesus, Isaiah, Mohammad, Spinoza, and Shakespeare told us. It is all the same: There is no escaping from ourselves. The human dilemma is as it has always been, and it is a delusion to believe that the technological changes of our era have rendered irrelevant the wisdom of the ages and the sages.</p> <p>Nonetheless, having said this, I know perfectly well that because we do live in a technological age, we have some special problems that Jesus, Hillel, Socrates, and Micah did not and could not speak of. I do not have the wisdom to say what we ought to do about such problems, and so my contribution must confine itself to some things we need to know in order to address the problems. I call my talk Five Things We Need to Know About Technological Change. I base these ideas on my thirty years of studying the history of technological change but I do not think these are academic or esoteric ideas. They are to the sort of things everyone who is concerned with cultural stability and balance should know and I offer them to you in the hope that you will find them useful in thinking about the effects of technology on religious faith.  </p>"},{"location":"share/Five-things-we-need-to-know-about-technological-change.html#first-idea---culture-always-pays-a-price-for-technology","title":"First Idea - Culture always pays a price for technology","text":"<p>The first idea is that all technological change is a trade-off. I like to call it a Faustian bargain. Technology giveth and technology taketh away. This means that for every advantage a new technology offers, there is always a corresponding disadvantage. The disadvantage may exceed in importance the advantage, or the advantage may well be worth the cost. Now, this may seem to be a rather obvious idea, but you would be surprised at how many people believe that new technologies are unmixed blessings. You need only think of the enthusiasms with which most people approach their understanding of computers. Ask anyone who knows something about computers to talk about them, and you will find that they will, unabashedly and relentlessly, extol the wonders of computers. You will also find that in most cases they will completely neglect to mention any of the liabilities of computers. This is a dangerous imbalance, since the greater the wonders of a technology, the greater will be its negative consequences.</p> <p>Think of the automobile, which for all of its obvious advantages, has poisoned our air, choked our cities, and degraded the beauty of our natural landscape. Or you might reflect on the paradox of medical technology which brings wondrous cures but is, at the same time, a demonstrable cause of certain diseases and disabilities, and has played a significant role in reducing the diagnostic skills of physicians. It is also well to recall that for all of the intellectual and social benefits provided by the printing press, its costs were equally monumental. The printing press gave the Western world prose, but it made poetry into an exotic and elitist form of communication. It gave us inductive science, but it reduced religious sensibility to a form of fanciful superstition. Printing gave us the modern conception of nationhood, but in so doing turned patriotism into a sordid if not lethal emotion. We might even say that the printing of the Bible in vernacular languages introduced the impression that God was an Englishman or a German or a Frenchman\u2014that is to say, printing reduced God to the dimensions of a local potentate.  Perhaps the best way I can express this idea is to say that the question, \u201cWhat will a new technology do?\u201d is no more important than the question, \u201cWhat will a new technology undo?\u201d Indeed, the latter question is more important, precisely because it is asked so infrequently. One might say, then, that a sophisticated perspective on technological change includes one\u2019s being skeptical of Utopian and Messianic visions drawn by those who have no sense of history or of the precarious balances on which culture depends. In fact, if it were up to me, I would forbid anyone from talking about the new information technologies unless the person can demonstrate that he or she knows something about the social and psychic effects of the alphabet, the mechanical clock, the printing press, and telegraphy. In other words, knows something about the costs of great technologies.</p> <p>Idea Number One, then, is that culture always pays a price for technology.</p>"},{"location":"share/Five-things-we-need-to-know-about-technological-change.html#second-idea---there-are-always-winners-and-losers-in-technological-change","title":"Second Idea - There are always winners and losers in technological change","text":"<p>This leads to the second idea, which is that the advantages and disadvantages of new technologies are never distributed evenly among the population. This means that every new technology benefits some and harms others. There are even some who are not affected at all. Consider again the case of the printing press in the 16<sup>th</sup> century, of which Martin Luther said it was \u201cGod\u2019s highest and extremest act of grace, whereby the business of the gospel is driven forward.\u201d By placing the word of God on every Christian\u2019s kitchen table, the mass-produced book undermined the authority of the church hierarchy, and hastened the breakup of the Holy Roman See. The Protestants of that time cheered this development. The Catholics were enraged and distraught. Since I am a Jew, had I lived at that time, I probably wouldn\u2019t have given a damn one way or another, since it would make no difference whether a pogrom was inspired by Martin Luther or Pope Leo X.  Some gain, some lose, a few remain as they were.</p> <p>Let us take as another example, television, although here I should add at once that in the case of television there are very few indeed who are not affected in one way or another. In America, where television has taken hold more deeply than anywhere else, there are many people who find it a blessing, not least those who have achieved high-paying, gratifying careers in television as executives, technicians, directors, newscasters and entertainers. On the other hand, and in the long run, television may bring an end to the careers of school teachers since school was an invention of the printing press and must stand or fall on the issue of how much importance the printed word will have in the future. There is no chance, of course, that television will go away but school teachers who are enthusiastic about its presence always call to my mind an image of some turn-of-the-century blacksmith who not only is singing the praises of the automobile but who also believes that his business will be enhanced by it. We know now that his business was not enhanced by it; it was rendered obsolete by it, as perhaps an intelligent blacksmith would have known.  The questions, then, that are never far from the mind of a person who is knowledgeable about technological change are these: Who specifically benefits from the development of a new technology? Which groups, what type of person, what kind of industry will be favored? And, of course, which groups of people will thereby be harmed?</p> <p>These questions should certainly be on our minds when we think about computer technology. There is no doubt that the computer has been and will continue to be advantageous to large-scale organizations like the military or airline companies or banks or tax collecting institutions. And it is equally clear that the computer is now indispensable to high-level researchers in physics and other natural sciences. But to what extent has computer technology been an advantage to the masses of people? To steel workers, vegetable store owners, automobile mechanics, musicians, bakers, bricklayers, dentists, yes, theologians, and most of the rest into whose lives the computer now intrudes? These people have had their private matters made more accessible to powerful institutions. They are more easily tracked and controlled; they are subjected to more examinations, and are increasingly mystified by the decisions made about them. They are more than ever reduced to mere numerical objects. They are being buried by junk mail. They are easy targets for advertising agencies and political institutions.</p> <p>In a word, these people are losers in the great computer revolution. The winners, which include among others computer companies, multi-national corporations and the nation state, will, of course, encourage the losers to be enthusiastic about computer technology. That is the way of winners, and so in the beginning they told the losers that with personal computers the average person can balance a checkbook more neatly, keep better track of recipes, and make more logical shopping lists. Then they told them that computers will make it possible to vote at home, shop at home, get all the entertainment they wish at home, and thus make community life unnecessary. And now, of course, the winners speak constantly of the Age of Information, always implying that the more information we have, the better we will be in solving significant problems\u2014 not only personal ones but large-scale social problems, as well. But how true is this? If there are children starving in the world\u2014and there are\u2014it is not because of insufficient information. We have known for a long time how to produce enough food to feed every child on the planet. How is it that we let so many of them starve? If there is violence on our streets, it is not because we have insufficient information. If women are abused, if divorce and pornography and mental illness are increasing, none of it has anything to do with insufficient information. I dare say it is because something else is missing, and I don\u2019t think I have to tell this audience what it is. Who knows? This age of information may turn out to be a curse if we are blinded by it so that we cannot see truly where our problems lie. That is why it is always necessary for us to ask of those who speak enthusiastically of computer technology, why do you do this? What interests do you represent? To whom are you hoping to give power? From whom will you be withholding power?</p> <p>I do not mean to attribute unsavory, let alone sinister motives to anyone. I say only that since technology favors some people and harms others, these are questions that must always be asked. And so, that there are always winners and losers in technological change is the second idea.</p>"},{"location":"share/Five-things-we-need-to-know-about-technological-change.html#third-idea---every-technology-has-an-embedded-epistemological-political-or-social-prejudice","title":"Third Idea - Every technology has an embedded epistemological, political or social prejudice","text":"<p>Here is the third. Embedded in every technology there is a powerful idea, sometimes two or three powerful ideas. These ideas are often hidden from our view because they are of a somewhat abstract nature. But this should not be taken to mean that they do not have practical consequences.</p> <p>Perhaps you are familiar with the old adage that says: To a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail.  We may extend that truism: To a person with a pencil, everything looks like a sentence. To a person with a TV camera, everything looks like an image. To a person with a computer, everything looks like data. I do not think we need to take these aphorisms literally. But what they call to our attention is that every technology has a prejudice. Like language itself, it predisposes us to favor and value certain perspectives and accomplishments. In a culture without writing, human memory is of the greatest importance, as are the proverbs, sayings and songs which contain the accumulated oral wisdom of centuries. That is why Solomon was thought to be the wisest of men. In Kings I we are told he knew 3,000 proverbs. But in a culture with writing, such feats of memory are considered a waste of time, and proverbs are merely irrelevant fancies.  The writing person favors logical organization and systematic analysis, not proverbs. The telegraphic person values speed, not introspection. The television person values immediacy, not history. And computer people, what shall we say of them? Perhaps we can say that the computer person values information, not knowledge, certainly not wisdom. Indeed, in the computer age, the concept of wisdom may vanish altogether.</p> <p>The third idea, then, is that every technology has a philosophy which is given expression in how the technology makes people use their minds, in what it makes us do with our bodies, in how it codifies the world, in which of our senses it amplifies, in which of our emotional and intellectual tendencies it disregards. This idea is the sum and substance of what the great Catholic prophet, Marshall McLuhan meant when he coined the famous sentence, \u201cThe medium is the message.\u201d</p>"},{"location":"share/Five-things-we-need-to-know-about-technological-change.html#fourth-idea---technological-change-is-not-additive-it-is-ecological","title":"Fourth Idea - Technological change is not additive; it is ecological","text":"<p>Here is the fourth idea: Technological change is not additive; it is ecological. I can explain this best by an analogy. What happens if we place a drop of red dye into a beaker of clear water? Do we have clear water plus a spot of red dye? Obviously not. We have a new coloration to every molecule of water. That is what I mean by ecological change. A new medium does not add something; it changes everything. In the year 1500, after the printing press was invented, you did not have old Europe plus the printing press. You had a different Europe. After television, America was not America plus television. Television gave a new coloration to every political campaign, to every home, to every school, to every church, to every industry, and so on.</p> <p>That is why we must be cautious about technological innovation. The consequences of technological change are always vast, often unpredictable and largely irreversible. That is also why we must be suspicious of capitalists. Capitalists are by definition not only personal risk takers but, more to the point, cultural risk takers. The most creative and daring of them hope to exploit new technologies to the fullest, and do not much care what traditions are overthrown in the process or whether or not a culture is prepared to function without such traditions. Capitalists are, in a word, radicals. In America, our most significant radicals have always been capitalists\u2014men like Bell, Edison, Ford, Carnegie, Sarnoff, Goldwyn. These men obliterated the 19<sup>th</sup> century, and created the 20<sup>th</sup>, which is why it is a mystery to me that capitalists are thought to be conservative. Perhaps it is because they are inclined to wear dark suits and grey ties.  I trust you understand that in saying all this, I am making no argument for socialism. I say only that capitalists need to be carefully watched and disciplined. To be sure, they talk of family, marriage, piety, and honor but if allowed to exploit new technology to its fullest economic potential, they may undo the institutions that make such ideas possible. And here I might just give two examples of this point, taken from the American encounter with technology. The first concerns education. Who, we may ask, has had the greatest impact on American education in this century? If you are thinking of John Dewey or any other education philosopher, I must say you are quite wrong. The greatest impact has been made by quiet men in grey suits in a suburb of New York City called Princeton, New Jersey. There, they developed and promoted the technology known as the standardized test, such as IQ tests, the SATs and the GREs. Their tests redefined what we mean by learning, and have resulted in our reorganizing the curriculum to accommodate the tests.</p> <p>A second example concerns our politics. It is clear by now that the people who have had the most radical effect on American politics in our time are not political ideologues or student protesters with long hair and copies of Karl Marx under their arms. The radicals who have changed the nature of politics in America are entrepreneurs in dark suits and grey ties who manage the large television industry in America. They did not mean to turn political discourse into a form of entertainment. They did not mean to make it impossible for an overweight person to run for high political office. They did not mean to reduce political campaigning to a 30-second TV commercial. All they were trying to do is to make television into a vast and unsleeping money machine. That they destroyed substantive political discourse in the process does not concern them.  </p>"},{"location":"share/Five-things-we-need-to-know-about-technological-change.html#fifth-idea---technology-tends-to-become-mythic","title":"Fifth Idea - Technology tends to become mythic","text":"<p>I come now to the fifth and final idea, which is that media tend to become mythic. I use this word in the sense in which it was used by the French literary critic, Roland Barthes. He used the word \u201cmyth\u201d to refer to a common tendency to think of our technological creations as if they were God-given, as if they were a part of the natural order of things. I have on occasion asked my students if they know when the alphabet was invented. The question astonishes them. It is as if I asked them when clouds and trees were invented.  The alphabet, they believe, was not something that was invented. It just is. It is this way with many products of human culture but with none more consistently than technology. Cars, planes, TV, movies, newspapers\u2014they have achieved mythic status because they are perceived as gifts of nature, not as artifacts produced in a specific political and historical context.  </p> <p>When a technology become mythic, it is always dangerous because it is then accepted as it is, and is therefore not easily susceptible to modification or control. If you should propose to the average American that television broadcasting should not begin until 5 PM and should cease at 11 PM, or propose that there should be no television commercials, he will think the idea ridiculous. But not because he disagrees with your cultural agenda. He will think it ridiculous because he assumes you are proposing that something in nature be changed; as if you are suggesting that the sun should rise at 10 AM instead of at 6.  Whenever I think about the capacity of technology to become mythic, I call to mind the remark made by Pope John Paul II. He said, \u201cScience can purify religion from error and superstition. Religion can purify science from idolatry and false absolutes.\u201d</p> <p>What I am saying is that our enthusiasm for technology can turn into a form of idolatry and our belief in its beneficence can be a false absolute. The best way to view technology is as a strange intruder, to remember that technology is not part of God\u2019s plan but a product of human creativity and hubris, and that its capacity for good or evil rests entirely on human awareness of what it does for us and to us.  </p>"},{"location":"share/Five-things-we-need-to-know-about-technological-change.html#conclusion","title":"Conclusion","text":"<p>And so, these are my five ideas about technological change. First, that we always pay a price for technology; the greater the technology, the greater the price. Second, that there are always winners and losers, and that the winners always try to persuade the losers that they are really winners. Third, that there is embedded in every great technology an epistemological, political or social prejudice. Sometimes that bias is greatly to our advantage. Sometimes it is not. The printing press annihilated the oral tradition; telegraphy annihilated space; television has humiliated the word; the computer, perhaps, will degrade community life. And so on. Fourth, technological change is not additive; it is ecological, which means, it changes everything and is, therefore, too important to be left entirely in the hands of Bill Gates. And fifth, technology tends to become mythic; that is, perceived as part of the natural order of things, and therefore tends to control more of our lives than is good for us.</p> <p>If we had more time, I could supply some additional important things about technological change but I will stand by these for the moment, and will close with this thought. In the past, we experienced technological change in the manner of sleep-walkers. Our unspoken slogan has been \u201ctechnology \u00fcber alles,\u201d and we have been willing to shape our lives to fit the requirements of technology, not the requirements of culture.  This is a form of stupidity, especially in an age of vast technological change. We need to proceed with our eyes wide open so that we many use technology rather than be used by it.</p>"},{"location":"share/my-publications.html","title":"My Publications","text":"<p>A list of 30 formal academic publications.

Properly addressing this complexity requires knowledge which costs time &amp; money. Most current approaches fail to address this. </p> <p>esler\u2019s law arose from the practice of interaction design (IxD).

The only question is who will have to deal with it\u201d. Think of \u201capplication\u201d as a \u201cdigital space\u201d. Attached visual representation of Tesler\u2019s Law from https://harishsnotebook.wordpress.com/2018/08/19/teslers-law-of-the-conservation-of-complexity/ </p> <p></p> <p>Applications were once hard to use. Computers couldn\u2019t do much. Applications had to be small. Not easy to use. The user had to deal with the complexity and consequently not many people did. Arguably a problem that applies to many contemporary digital learning spaces. 6/31</p> <p>Over time computers became more powerful. Developers could start making applications that were easier to use. Importantly, the overall complexity didn\u2019t go away. It was conserved. Now the developer had to deal with the complexity, not the user. 7/31</p> <p>This is due to the Law of Requisite Variety https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(cybernetics) If someone wanted to do X, either they or the application had to support all the steps required to do X. The only way to reduce complexity was to change X to something that required less steps. 8/31</p> <p>Since complexity is conserved. Developers have to deal with it. Inevitably different developers would deal with the complexity differently. That variety would push some complexity back to the user. Making the application more complex again. 9/31</p> <p>Tesler\u2019s solution was to change a 2 layer model to 3 layers. The 2 levels were the application (e.g. Word processor or digital learning space) &amp; a collection of shared software components used to build applications. Tesler added a \u201cgeneric application\u201d layer between them 10/31</p> <p>The \u201cgeneric application\u201d acted as a template for how an application should work. (e.g. Windows, menus, commands). Developers would use this template to produce their specific application. All applications would have a common user interface. Reducing the user\u2019s complexity. 11/31</p> <p>The developers complexity is reduced because of the knowledge embedded within the \u201cgeneric application\u201d. The complexity has been conserved, but it\u2019s been pushed into the generic application. 12/31</p> <p>Another IxD pioneer @asktog suggested a 2<sup>nd</sup> order effect of this.

Shared software components == collection of digital software (e.g. LMS, eportfolio, Zoom etc). Developer == the teacher (Or, if lucky, a team of educational technologists, curriculum designers etc). 14/31</p> <p>Creating an effective digital learning space is hard. See the 1<sup>st</sup> couple of paragraphs in https://djon.es/blog/2019/08/08/exploring-knowledge-reuse-in-design-for-digital-learning-tweaks-h5p-constructive-templates-and-casa/  Learning how to do do this in a week is really, really hard. Can Tesler\u2019s three layer model help? 15/31</p> <p>Arguably, higher education institutions have tried a number of approaches to adding an intermediate layer between the shared software components and the application. Tesler\u2019s law &amp; related ideas seem to provide an interesting way of analysing these approaches. 16/31</p> <p>Approaches, include 1. Specifying a set of L&amp;T software 2. Developing L&amp;T standards  3. Providing professional development 4. Mandating a generic course site template 5. Provision of specialised course development teams 6. Provision of activity specific templates  17/31</p> <p>While most of these may be useful. My argument is that all have important limitations when it comes to actually addressing Tesler\u2019s Law of the Conversation of Complexity. 18/31</p> <p>Most fail to reduce the complexity faced by the teacher. I suggest that to sustainably improve the quality of digital learning spaces this must be reduced WITHOUT overly reducing the potential capabilities of the final digital learning space. 19/31</p> <ol> <li>Specifying a set of L&amp;T applications. A limited set means people don\u2019t have to know about every possible application (complexity reduction). Problems arise from the law of requsite variety. A specified set of applications, won\u2019t support all the necessary variety. 20/31</li> </ol> <p>Problem #2 having a specified set of L&amp;T applications doesn\u2019t help with the complexity of integrating these separate applications into a usable digital learning space. (Anyone who\u2019s tried to integrate an LMS with an eportfolio system knows this pain) 21/31</p> <ol> <li>Institutional L&amp;T standards add another layer of abstraction. Not only do teachers need to understand technology &amp; their pedagogical goals. They need to know how to translate their goals into the standards. This practice initially increases complexity!!! 22/31</li> </ol> <p>If teachers remain at an institution &amp; the institution keeps the standards for many years, then the standards might be internalised and potentially reduce complexity. But even then, they don\u2019t help with the act of implementing the digital learning space, only the design. 23/31</p> <ol> <li> <p>Professional development doesn\u2019t reduce complexity. At best, it provides teachers with the knowledge to deal with the complexity. If they have the time and PD is available that helps address the complexity specific to their pedagogical goals (rather than generic goals) 24/31</p> </li> <li> <p>Standard course sites. Break the rule of requisite variety by preventing a course site from responding to contextual differences. Also only work around the edges of a digital learning space. Teacher still deals with the complexity at the core of L&amp;T. 25/31</p> </li> </ol> <p>There\u2019s also the issue of standard course sites being change that is often done TO teachers, rather than something that is done with them. 26/31</p> <ol> <li> <p>Specialised development teams including technologists, instructional designers etc working with teaching staff.

As people looking to help people learn we can't make them learn. The best we can do is to create learning situations - see Goodyear, Carvalho &amp; Yeoman (2021) for why I'm using situation and not environment. We design the task, the learning space and social organisation (alone, pairs, groups etc.) that make up the situation in which they will engage in some activity. Hopefully activity that will lead to the learning outcomes we had in mind when designing the situation.</p> <p>But maybe not. We can't be certain. All we can do is create a learning situation that is more likely to encourage them to engage in \"good\" activity.</p> <p>How much do the little things matter in the design of these learning situations?</p> <p>We spend an awful lot of time on the big picture things. A lot of time is spent on: creating, mapping and aligning learning outcomes; ensuring we've chosen the right task informed by the right learning theory and research to achieve those outcomes; and, a lot of time selecting, building, and supporting the physical and digital learning spaces in which the activity will take place. But what about the little things?</p> <p>Are the little things important? I'm not sure, but in my experience the little things are typically ignored. Is that experience? Why are they ignored? What impact does this have on learners and learning?</p> <p>Some early thinking about these questions follow. Not to mention the bigger question, if we can't get the little things right, what does that say about our ability to get the big things right?</p>"},{"location":"share/blog/do-little-things-matter.html#what-are-some-little-things","title":"What are some \"little things\"?","text":"<p>To paraphrase Potter Stewart I won't attempt to define \"little things\" but rather show what I think I mean with a couple of examples from recent experience. </p>"},{"location":"share/blog/do-little-things-matter.html#specific-dates","title":"Specific dates","text":"<p>For better or worse, dates are important in formal education.

Since the print-based distance education days of the 80s and 90s the tendency has been to make learning materials (physical or digital) \"stand-alone\". i.e. independent of a particular study period so that they can be reused again and again.

It's not unusual for different offerings of the same course to use different sites within the LMS.

The emphasis on reuse is a plus, but comes at the cost of reducing the pedagogic value. With the rise of micro-credentials and the flexible reuse of modular learning materials this is only going to be more of a factor moving forward. </p> <p>The reusability paradox extends to the tools we use to produce and host our learning sitations (e.g. various forms of LMS and the latest shiny things like Microsoft Teams). Any tool that's designed to be sold/used by the broadest possible market tends to be designed to be reusable. It doesn't know a lot about the specifics of one individual context. For example, it doesn't know about the dates for the institution's study periods, let alone the dates important for an individual learning situation. </p>"},{"location":"share/blog/do-little-things-matter.html#hierarchical-versus-distributed","title":"Hierarchical versus Distributed","text":"<p>Second, is the difference between a hierarchical (tree-like) and distributed conception of the world. Most contemporary professional practices (e.g. software development, design for learning, and managing organisations) is hierarchical. A tree of black box components responsible for specific purposes. With the complexity and detail of each activity hidden from view. The functionality of an LMS is generally organised this way. There's a lot of value in this approach, but it makes it very difficult to do something in across each of the black boxes. To be distributed. For example, make sure that all the dates and links mentioned in the discussion forums, the quizzes, the content areas, the lecture slides etc. are correct.</p> <p>This is also visible at an organisational level. It appears that offering specific dates for assignemnts and the linked are typically entered into some sort of administrative system that produces a formal profile/synopsis for a course/unit. Learning typically takes place elsewhere (e.g. the LMS). Extra work has to be performed to transfer information between the two systems. Work to transfer such information between systems is typically only done for \"important\" tasks. e.g. transfering grades out of the LMS into the student administration system.</p>"},{"location":"share/blog/do-little-things-matter.html#limited-focus-on-forward-oriented-design","title":"Limited focus on forward-oriented design","text":"<p>Third, is limited attention paid to forward-oriented design (Goodyear &amp; Dimitriadis, 2013).

In particular, pondering a tweet from @gamerlearner where the idea is that a \"consistent requirement for educators in HE to have some kind of formal teaching qual\" will not only help motivate academics \"to take time out to learn how to teach better\" and generally value teaching more.</p> <p></p> <p>It is somewhat troubling and inconsistent that there is no requirement for university academics to have formal teaching qualifications. But I don't see how such a requirement by itself will fix issues with the quality of learning and teaching in universities. Especially in the context of Australian higher education given the growing complexity learning and teaching arising from on-going change (e.g. micro-credentials, WIL, multi-modal, flexible, COVID...)</p> <p>Instead, requiring formal qualifications appears to be a simple solution to a complex problem. It is a solution that seems to fall into the second of three levels of improving teaching - \"What management does\". It is a solution that allows someone to \"lead\" the implementation of a project (e.g. the institutional implementation of HEA fellowships), pass some policies, deliver against some KPIs, and provide demonstrable evidence that the institution takes learning and teaching seriously.</p> <p>While this is going on the reality of teaching reveals a different story about how seriously learning and teaching are taken. Some examples follow, but there are many more (e.g. I don't even mention the great value placed on research). Workload formulas specify a maximum of 30 minutes for all outside class student interactions per student. There is significant rhetoric around moving away from lectures, but workload formulas are built around time-tabling lecture theatres. A significant proportion of teaching is done by fantastic but under paid sessional staff often appointed at the last minute. The systems and technologies provided to support learning and teaching are disjointed, require significant extra work to be somewhat useful. Mainly because they can't even provide the simplest of functionality or help do the little things.</p> <p>Given this mismatch, is it any surprise that there are concerns and signs that any requirement for formal teaching qualifications is likely to lead to task corruption. At the individual level, as @AmandasAudit suggests \"how many will short cut and just phone it in?\". At the organisational level, e.g. @scotxc argues that it becomes \"very easy to become a box-ticking exercises for uni's to say 'They're qualified!!'\". </p> <p>My argument is that actually improving learning and teaching requires moving to level 3 of improving teaching - \"What the teacher does\". What Biggs (2001) suggests as focusing on teaching, not individual teachers. Ensuring that the institutional systems, processes, policies etc. all encourage and enable effective teaching practice and move toward a distributive view of learning and knowledge.</p> <p>This is not a simple task. It is complex. It is a wicked problem. There is no simple solution. There is no silver bullet. Formal teaching qualifications might be part of the broader solution, but I can't see it being the solution. I'm not convinced it is even likely to be the most beneficial contributor.</p>"},{"location":"share/blog/on-formal-qualifications-and-improving-learning-and-teaching.html#references","title":"References","text":"<p>Biggs, J.

We taught courses on-campus and via second generation distance education. Second generation distance education involved an industralised approach to the design and production of study material packages that were mailed out to students. Students who never set foot on a campus and rarely talked directly to another student or teacher. </p> <p>Teachers designed the study materials, sometimes with the help of a team. A central organisational unit produced and distributed the study materials. A key role for that central unit was ensuring consistency and improving quality. Dekkers and Kemp (1995) describe the thinking that went into the production of this study material. </p> <p>Dekkers and Kemp were senior leaders in the unit that produced and distributed the study materials I produced. Their chapter (Dekkers and Kemp, 1995) raises an issue that was a concern to them in the mid 1990s. They note that technologies emerging at the time enabled the development of \"learning materials to suit a range of learner settings, styles and other individual requirements\" (p. 313). Their concern was that the material developed with these technologies gave little thought to \"legibility, readability and, importantly, how the materials will be used\" (p. 313). Instead, these materials were design on the basis of \"the developer's own beliefs about what consistitutes 'good' typographical layout\" (p. 313).</p> <p>The solution adopted at my institution (and I assume elsewhere) was the adoption of consistent typographical standards informed by research. Dekkers and Kemp (1995) provide a long table outlining these typographical standards. Standards that were enforced by the industralised approach inherent in second generation distance education. Teachers provided the raw content for the study material. The distance education unit applied the research informed typographical standards to transform those raw materials into consistently legible and readable study materials.</p> <p>Consistency wins. Diversity hits back.</p> <p>The following is code written in the Prolog programming language (taken from this page). In the early 1990s I was tutor in a Machine Intelligence course using Prolog taken by on-campus and distance education students. A few weeks into the course there was problems. Distance education students were complaining that none of the programs in the study material would run when they entered them into their computers.</p> <p>A problem caused by the research informed typographical standards and their consistent application to all materials.</p> <pre><code>main :-\n    nl,\n    write('&gt;   Enter a selection followed by a period.'), nl,\n    write('&gt;   1. Run a query'), nl,\n    write('&gt;   2. Exit'), nl, nl,\n    read(Choice),\n    run_opt(Choice), main.\n</code></pre> <p>One of the typographical standards was, thou shall not use single quotes. All quotes had to be double. Hence the desktop publishers/copy editors in the distance education unit would automatically change all single quotes in provided study material to double quotes.</p> <p>They forgot to tell the makers of the Prolog programming environments that they shouldn't be using single quotes.</p>"},{"location":"share/blog/peak-homogenisation-in-post-digital-education.html#the-rise-of-online-learning-when-diversity-was-king","title":"The rise of online learning: When diversity was king","text":"<p>The rise of online learning through the 1990s and 2000s killed second generation distance education.

Especially, if you're having to deal with scale - large student numbers, large numbers of courses, multiple offerings etc.</p> <p>Joyce's work is important work because it engages with one of the more challenging questions facing higher education</p> <p>How might the diverse knowledge required for effective design for digital learning be shared and used sustainably at scale?</p> <p>aka. how do Universities move beyond providing guidance and actually help with the provision of digital education.</p> <p>The literature (e.g. the intro of Jones, 2019) recognises this question as essential to higher education, but also identifies significant problems with existing solutions. Buying new technology, running PD sessions outlining the \"5 guidelines for X\", or doing ad hoc instructional design projects aren't cutting it. The work Joyce and her colleagues are doing with Learning Design Systems draws on successful practices from a different realm in an attempt to systematically answer the question.</p> <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBU76mlA0_w</p> <p>Upon reflection, I'm wondering if I missed something in Joyce's talk? Perhaps my limitations and the limitations of a (less than) 60 minute webinar on a complex topic are showing. The bit I missed - the components of the design system - appear to be one of the key enablers of scale in web design systems.

What Joyce didn't mention directly is that in higher education the practice of teaching as design for learning isn't as widespread as it should be. In part, because effective design for learning requires a detailed and diverse collection of knowledge. Knowledge that not many teachers have and which institutions continue to struggle with providing at scale.</p> <p>Joyce's solution to this scaling problem is design systems. An idea drawn directly from web design. In web design, design systems specify in detail the common components that are used to design a web sites and applications (Churchill, 2019). Joyce points to design systems examples such as Atlassian and one more focused on digital learning from Future Learn. Churchill (2019) points to this gallery of different (web) design systems. </p> <p>The fundamental idea behind design systems is not new. Manufacturing, industrial design, and architecture (e.g. Alexander et al, 1977) have been using collection of modular components to share the knowledge required to construct large scale products for quite a while. Suarez et al (n.d) cite McIlroy's (1968) proposal for software components as a solution to the (first?) software crisis as inspiration for design systems. Tesler's Law of the Conservation of Complexity arises from addressing a similar problem 20 years later in dealing with the production of GUI software. The hypermedia community was talking about patterns and constructive templates in the late 1990s (Nanard, Nanard &amp; Khan, 1998). Echoing work in object oriented programming (Gamma et al, 1995) that had significant impact on practice, and later work with design patterns for educational design and network learning (Jones, 1999; Goodyear, 2005) - that had less impact on practice.</p>"},{"location":"share/blog/reflections-on-design-systems-talk.html#what-is-a-design-system","title":"What is a design system?","text":"<p>I was looking for a definition of a design system to use in this post.

A component that recognises the film availability changes and hence the learning materials need to be kept up to date. A process that can be painful if the film is mentioned multiple times.

The literature has identified that this is a resource intensive approach and that such resources are not always possible. Joyce explains how their design system has reduced the required resources, enabling more scale. However, there is a limit to that. It's not possible (yet, perhaps) in all contexts. It's certainly not possible in the context in which I currently work. Nor has it been possible in any university in which I've worked over the last 30 years. Even in an earlys 90s distance education provider - where a team approach was nominally possible - it was heavily constrained in terms of staffing and restricted to a very specific set of standards.

The question then is, if you can't rely on a project team to bring together the necessary design knowledge to help improve distance education, then how do you do it?</p> <p>Goodyear (2009) introduces two images of teachers: long arc; and, short arc. The long arc teacher takes time to think about designing a course and associated tasks. A short arc teacher doesn't have that time. Arguably, the prevalence of short arc teachers is increasing. The long arc teacher image is the focus of almost all attempts by institutions to provide \"help\", which is probably why \"most of the effort by L&amp;T centres is directed to a small minority of willing academics\" and such \"centres are not equipped or motivated to operate strategically, at scale\" (Ellis &amp; Goodyear, 2019, p. 202). Goodyear's (2009) suggestion to help short arc teachers - who won't make use of traditional support measures, but do use a range of tools - is to \"embed good ideas in these tools\" (p. 16). </p> <p>The image of the short arc teacher echoes the idea of a bricoleur. Someone when faced with a project does not engage in strategic analysis and design, but rather figures out how to achieve the project with the tools (and knowledge) already at hand. They engage in bricolage. Bricolage is a concept that has been previously used to understand the work that teachers typically do (Hatton, 1989). Given the nature of bricolage, if what the bricoleur is doing is less than stellar, then the issue lays with the tools that they have at hand.</p> <p>I'm wondering if providing an effective learning activity design system might help address this? i.e. more than just a collection of web design templates, but a collection of components at the organism and template level of the Atomic Design Methodology. Components that provide support for the forward-oriented design of situated learning activities.

Components that are not simply collections of purchased technologies, but proactively designed to explicitly support the forward-oriented design of valued learning activities.</p> <p>The card interface is one of my early attempts at providing this type of support (Jones, 2019). The origins of the Card Interface was a startegically important push by the institution (for better or worse) to encourage the modularisation of online learning content. But the tools at hand really didn't provide significant support to that activity. The Card Interface does a better job. It's a tool that's been used both by project teams and \"short-arc\" academics.

The spaces, tools and tasks in and through which students \"do stuff\" (i.e. learning, or not) are in some way designed by a teacher with subsequent learner adaptation (Goodyear, 2020). </p> <p>Designing learning spaces, tools and tasks is not easy. Especially when digital technologies are involved. The low digital fluency of teachers is seen as a (for some the) significant challenge (Johnson et al, 2014). Hence the big focus on solutions such as requiring all teachers to have a formal teaching qualification. Formal \"certification\" programs such as the HEA. Or the focus on running workshops and producing online \"how-to\" support material. The focus on teacher knowledge tends to ignore the distributed and contextual nature of the knowledge required. It doesn't just reside in the heads of the teachers but is distributed amongst the other agents (people, technologies, policies etc) in the institutional learning and teaching system (Jones et al, 2015).</p> <p>When knowledge is distributed, it is also situated and highly contextual. As such, knowing the details of any learning and teaching model or theory has value still has to be translated into the design of learning activities within a specific learning and teaching context. The model's suggestions needs to be adapted and customised to the specifics of the learning activity, including the specific discipline, the specific digital technologies, the specific institutional policies, the specific student cohort etc. This is hard and I don't know of any institution that is helping meaningfully and sustainably make this problem easier in contextually and discipline specific ways.</p> <p>This post will</p> <ol> <li>Introduce a discipline specific learning activity.</li> <li>Describe the learner and teacher experiences of engaging with current common implementations of that learning activity.</li> <li>Illustrate how the learner and teacher experience is changed by a more discipline specific approach.</li> <li>Explore some of the implications and next steps for this approach.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"share/blog/supporting-the-design-of-discipline-specific-learning-spaces.html#watching-films---a-discipline-specific-activity","title":"Watching films - a discipline-specific activity","text":"<p>A key activity for courses such as film analysis, history, direction etc. is watching films.

In a totally online learning experience this is commonly done via the course web site. Either way the teacher/institution typically organises access to the film and designs some activity around it.</p> <p>This type of close analysis of a film typically only a part of a handful (or two) of courses at a university. If there's any institutional support for this activity it is typically a small part of a broader process. e.g. legally (copyright) correct sourcing of films may be part of the library service.

The separate technologies don't assemble easily with other institutional technologies, let alone personal technologies.     e.g. PebblePad (and just about everything else) and its integration with Blackboard.     Training tends not to focus on assembly.     Technological and educational training tends to focus on the basic principles or features. Not on assembly/orchestration. In part because of the artificial distinction between technology and education, rather than Dron's \"it's all technology\".     Help with assembly is limited in quality and quantity.     Most of what the LTCs and GO do is help with assembly. But often the assembly we help with is more about our fixed assemblies and our ideas of purpose, rather than contextual assemblies.  And we only help very few of the total # of courses.     What passes for purpose is abstract and decontextualised.     Ideas about the purpose of L&amp;T are hugely variable (e.g. invigilated exams versus assignment based, grading versus ungrading etc). Traditional management practices requires common institutional purpose. That becomes abstract and decontextualised (e.g. the tendency of institutional graduate attributes to all be a variation on a theme) Hence any orchestration that happens is focused on this abstract/de-contextualised purpose. Not on the purpose of offering the best orchestration for a specific course of learning experience.     Here comes the proxy purpose.     But abstract/de-contextualised is hard to use as a guide for daily work. Hence those purposes get replaced by proxies. e.g. our job is to keep Blackboard going.

RPA software can do most of what a human can do with other software - hence \"robotic\". Most RPA vendors also claim the magic ingredient of AI adding to the \"robotic\" flavour. RPA software supports the creation of \"scripts\" of direct the \"robot's\" activities. Scripts that can be repeated without human intervention as often as required - hence \"process automation\".

They suggest that traditional process automation - typically large scale information systems projects - address the large number of cases that use the same structured process (the left-hand end of the graph).

In particular, when these cases often rely on proprietary or legacy information systems that enterprise automation can't work with. Traditional process automation - like all traditional enterprise information systems - require long and expensive implementations resulting in relatively inflexible systems, whereas RPA aims for \"quick wins that require little investment\" (van der Aalst, 2018, p. 271).

The NGDLE rationale is that no one digital technology (e.g. the LMS) can provide it all. You'll need an ecosystem that will \"allow individuals and institutions the opportunity to construct learning environments tailored to their requirements and goals\u201d (Brown et al., 2015, p. 1).</p> <p>Recent personal experience suggests, however, that what currently passes for such an ecosystem is a collection of disaparte tools. Where each tool has its own set of symbols to represent what it does. Symbols that typically aren't those assumed by other tools in the ecosystem, or commonly in use by the individuals and organisations using the tools. The main current solution to this symbolic tower of babel is the LTI standard, which defines a standard way for these disparate tools to share information. Information that is pretty much the same standard symbols identified above. i.e. student identity, perhaps membership, and marks/grades.</p> <p>Consquently, the act of constructing a learning environment tailored to the requirements of an individual or a course is achieved by somehow understanding and cobbling together these disaparate symbol systems and the technologies that embody them.

Which appears to finally provide digital technology that is supporting symbol computation that is directly related to learning and teaching and can be used across a variety of tasks and contexts.</p> <p>But I do wonder how to bridge the final gap. While this approach promises a way to bridge curriculum design and project managing the implementation of that design. It doesn't yet actively help with the implementation of that design. If and how might you bridge the standard symbols used by ABC Learning Design and the disparate collection of different symbol systems embedded in the tech ecosystem provided to implement it?</p> <p>Learning Design tools like LAMS used something like the \"one-ring-to-rule-them-all\"/LMS approach and then engaged with something like the LTI approach. So either there was a single system that could define its own symbol system and ignore the rest of the world.

A post reflecting on the types of requests for help being asked as people try to make the COVID \"move online\". For me, there's a suggestion that there are some help requests that were being answered well. e.g. Questions that lead to a \u201cpush this button\u201d answer. But trouble begins as the questions begin to deepen into questions that don\u2019t have easy answers (e.g. \u201chow do I get student engagement?). Given the current context Lawrie\u2019s worry is \u201cthat in some places we are more concerened with providing sound guidance around pedagogical theory than we are with providing help\u201d. This is something I struggle with. I agree with Lawrie. There is a tendency in higher ed to provide guidance around difficult questions (e.g. how do I get student engagement?), rather than help. I agree with Lawrie that providing guidance is a \u201cget out of jail free card\u201d for the people providing it. It\u2019s much easier to explain the \u201c5 principles for encouraging student engagement\u201d than it is to work with someone to figure out how to sustainably adapt and apply those principles within a specific course context (including consideration of learners, teachers, agency, knowledge, content &amp; learning aims, available technologies, time and other constraints etc).

However, in 2020 it became core as part of the COVID response. Given the circumstances it is no surprise that chunks of that response were not that great. There was some good work. There was a lot of a \"good enough for the situation\" work. There was quite a bit that really sucked. For example,</p> <p></p> <p>Arugably, I'm not sure there's much difference from pre-COVID practice. Yes, COVID meant that the importance and spread of digital technology use was much, much higher. But, rapid adoption whilst responding to a pandemic was unlikely to be better (or as good?) qualitatively than previous practice. There just wasn't time for many to engage in the work required to question prior assumptions and redesign prior practices to suit the very different context and needs. Let alone harness technology transformatively.</p> <p>It is even less likely if - as I believe - most pre-COVID individual and organisational assumptions and practices around learning, teaching and technology were built on fairly limited conceptual foundations.

That most definitions of technology are vague, incomplete, and often contradictory. He goes into some detail why. Dron's definition draws on Arthur's (2009) definition of technlogy as (emphasis added)</p> <p>the orchestration of phenomena for some purpose (Dron, 2021, p. 1)</p> <p>Phenomena includes stuff that is \"real or imagined, mental or physical, designed or existing in the natural world\" (Dron, 2021, p. 2). Phenomena can be seen as belonging to physics (materials science for table tops), biology (human body climate requirements), chemistry etc. Phenomena can be: something you touch (the book you hold); another technology (the book you hold); a cognitive practice (reading); and, partially or entirely human enacted (think/pair/share, organisational processes etc).</p> <p>For Arthur, technological evolution comes from combining technologies. The phenomena being orchestrated in a technology can be another technology. Writing (technology) orchestrates language (technology) for another purpose. A purpose Socrates didn't much care for. Different combinations (assemblies) of technologies can be used for different purposes. New technologies are built using assemblies of existing technologies. There are inter-connected webs of technologies orchestrated by different people for different purposes.</p> <p>For example, in the classrooms above manufacturers of furniture orchestrated various physical and material phenomena to produce the chairs, desks and other furniture. Some other people - probably from institutional facilities management - orchestrated different combinations of furniture for the purpose of designing cost efficient and useful tutorial rooms. The folk designing the computer lab had a different purpose (provide computer lab with desktop computers) than the folk designing the classroom (provide a room that can be flexibly re-arranged). Those different purposes led to decisions about different approaches to orchestration of both similar and different phenomena.</p> <p>When the tutorial participants enter the room they start the next stage of orchestration for different, more learning and teaching specific purposes. Both students and teachers will have their own individual purposes in mind. Purposes that may change in respone to what happens in the tutorial. Those diverse purposes will drive them to orchestrate different phenomena in different ways. To achieve a particular learning outcome, a teacher will orchestrate different phenomena and technology. They will combine the technologies in the room with certain pedagogies (other technologies) to create specific learning tasks. The students then orchestrate how the learning tasks - purposeful orchestrations of phenomena - are adapted to serve their individual purposes.</p> <p>Some assemblies of technologies are easier to orchestrate than others (e.g. the computers in a computer lab can be used to play computer games, rather than \"learning\"). Collaborative small group pedagogies would probably be easier in the classroom, than the computer lab. The design of the furniture technology in the classroom has been orchestrated with the purpose of enabling this type of flexibility. Not so the computer lab.</p> <p>For Dron, pedagogies are a technology and education is a technology.

The inclusion of pedagogies in the empty classroom is more implicit than in the computer lab which shows people apparently engaged in a learning activity. The empty classroom implicitly illustrates some teacher-driven pedagogical assumptions in terms of how it is laid out. With the chairs and desks essentially in rows facing front.</p> <p>The teacher-driven pedagogical assumptions in the computer lab are more explicit and fixed. Not only because you can see the teacher up the front and the students apparently following along. But also because the teacher-driven pedagogical assumptions are enshrined in the computer lab. The rows in the computer lab are not designed to be moved (probably because of the phenomena associated with desktop computers, not the most moveable technologies). The seating positions for students are almost always going to be facing toward the teacher at the front of the room. There are even partitions between each student making collaboration and sharing more difficult.</p> <p>The classroom, however, is more flexible. It implicitly enables a number of different pedagogical assumptions. A number of different orchetrations of different phenomena. The chairs and tables can be moved. They could be pushed to sides of the room to open up a space for all sorts of large group and collaborative pedagogies. The shapes of the desks suggest that it would be possible to push four of them together to support small group pedagogies. Pedagogies that seek to assemble or orchestrate a very different set of mental and learning phenomena. The classroom is designed to be assembled in different ways.</p> <p>But beyond that both rooms appear embedded in the broader assembly of technology of formal education. They appear to be classrooms within the buildings of an educational institution. Use of these classrooms are likely scheduled according to a time-table.

Learning is natural. It occurs without explicit orchestration of phenomena for a purpose. He suggests that babies and non-human entities engage in this type of learning.

This produces some interesting insights. My question is whether or not Dron's definition can be usefully applied to my practitioner experience with educational technology within Australian Higher Education. This is a start.</p> <p>At this stage, I'm drawn to how Dron's definition breaks down the unhelpful duality between technology and pedagogy. Instead, it positions pedagogy and technology as \"just\" phenomena that the coparticipants in education will orchestrate for their purposes. Echoing the sociomaterial and postdigital turns.  The notions of hard and soft technologies and what they mean for orchestration also seem to offer an interesting lens to understand and guide institutional attempts to improve learning and teaching.</p> <p>Pulling apart Dron's (2021) definition</p> <p>the orchestration of phenomena for some purpose (Arthur, 2009, p. 51) seems to suggest the following questions about L&amp;T as being important 1. Purpose: whose purpose and what is the purpose? 2. Orchestration: how can orchestration happen and who is able orchestrate? 3. Phenomena: what phenomena/assemblies are being orchestrated?</p> <p>Questions that echo Fawn's (2020) argument using a postdigital perspective to argue against the pedagogy before technology purpose and landing on the following</p> <p>(context + purpose) drives (pedagogy [ which includes actual uses of technology])</p> <p>Withi this in mind, designing a tutorial in one of the rooms would start with the content and purpose. In this case the context is the web of existing technologies that have led you and your students being in the room ready for a tutorial. The purpose includes the espoused learning goals of the tutorial, but also the goals of all the other participants, including those that emerge during the orchestration of the tutorial. This context and purpose is then what ought to drive the orchestration of various phenomena (which Fawn labels \"pedagogy\") for that diverse and emergent collection of purposes.</p> <p>Suggesting that it might be useful if the focus for institutional attempts to improve learning and teaching aimed to improve the quality of that orchestration. The challenge is that the quality of that orchestration should be driven by context and purpose, which are inherently diverse and situated. A challenge which I don't think existing institutional practices are able to effectively deal with. Which is perhaps why discussions of quality learning and teaching in higher education \"privileges outcome measures at the expense of understanding the processes that generate those outcomes\" (Ellis and Goodyear, 2019, p. 2). </p> <p>It's easier to deal with abstract outcomes (very soft, non-specific technologies) than with the situated and contexual diversity of specifics and how to help with the orchestration of how to achieve those outcomes. In part, because many of the technologies that contribute to institutional L&amp;T are so hard to reassemble. Hence it's easier to put the blame on teaching staff (e.g. lack of teaching qualifications or digital fluency), than think about how the assembly of technologies that make up an institution should be rethought (e.g. this thread).</p> <p>More to come.</p>"},{"location":"share/blog/2021/exploring-drons-definition-of-educational-technology.html#references","title":"References","text":"<p>Arthur, W.

Seeking to maximise all three is argued by Ryan et al (2021) as a \"key issue for contemporary higher education\" (p. 1383) due to inevitable cost constraints, the benefits of increased access to higher education, and requirements to maintain quality standards. However, the literature on the \"iron triangle\" in higher education formed by these three vectors (Daniel et al, 2009; Mulder, 2013; Ryan et al, 2021) suggests that maximising all three is difficult, if not impossible. As illustrated in Figure 1 (adapted from Mulder, 2013, p. 100), the iron triangle suggests that changes in one quality (e.g. changing accessibility due to COVID) will have negatively impact at least one of the other qualities (e.g. the COVID response involving increase in workload for staff and resulting in less than happy participants). </p> Figure 1: Illustrating the iron triangle (adapted from Mulder, 2013, p. 100) <p>Much of the iron triangle literature identifies different strategies to breaking the iron triangle. Mulder (2013) suggests OER. Daniel et al (2009) suggest open and distance eLearning. Ryan et al (2021) suggest high-quality large group teaching and learning; alternative curriculum structures; and automation of assessment and feedback. I'm not convinced that any of these will work. Not due to the inherent validity of the specific solutions (though there are questions), instead my doubts arise from how such suggestions would be implemented in contemporary higher education. Each would be implemented via variations on common methods. My suspicion is that these  methods are likely to hinder any attempts to break the iron triangle. </p> <p>Largely because those methods are based on atomistic, and deterministic understandings of education, technology, and organisations. The standard methods - based on practices like stepwise refinement and loose coupling - may be necessary but aren't sufficient for breaking the iron triangle. These methods decompose problems into smaller black boxes (e.g. pedagogy-before-technology, requirements and implementation; enrolment, finance, and HR; learning objects etc.) for easier and separate resolution and assume that solving larger problems (e.g. designing a quality learning experience or migrating to a new LMS) is simply a matter of assembling a solution by combining component black boxes like lego blocks. Entangled views of pedagogy (Fawns, 2022), educational technology (Dron, 2022), and associated \"distributed\" views (Jones and Clark, 2014) argue that atomistic views are naive and simply don't match the reality of learning and teaching. Relying on such views to break the iron triangle appears unlikely to work.</p> <p>We're in the process of migrating from Blackboard Learn to Canvas. I work with one part of an institution responsible for migrating some 1400 courses (some with multiple course sites) over 18 months. An LMS migration \"is one of the most complex and labor-intensive initiatives that a university might undertake\" (Cottam, 2021, p. 66). Hence much of the organisation is expending effort to make sure it succeeds. This includes enterprise information technology players such as the new LMS vendor, our organisational IT division, and various other enterprise systems and practices. The following seeks to illustrate the mismatch between these practices and what we have to actually do as part of an LMS migration. The three standard LMS migration tasks discussed are:</p> <ol> <li>Connect the LMS with an ecosystem of tools using the Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) standard.</li> <li>Moving content from one LMS to another using the common cartridge standard.</li> <li>\"to make teaching and learning easier\" using a vanilla LMS.</li> </ol> <p>The following shares the challenges we faced as each of these standardised black boxes fell short. Each were so disconnected from our context and purpose to require significant manual re-entanglement to even approach being fit-for-purpose. Rather than persevere with an inefficient, manual approach to re-entanglement we did what many, many project teams have done before. We leveraged digital technologies to help automate the re-entanglement of these context-free and purposeless black boxes into fit-for-purpose assemblages that were more efficient, effective, and provided a foundation for on-going improvement and practice. Importantly, a key part of this re-entanglement was injecting some knowledge of learning design. Our improved assemblages are described below. </p> <p>What we're doing is not new. In the information systems literature it has been labelled light-weight Information Technology (IT) development, which Bygstad (2017) defines as \"a socio-technical knowledge regime driven by competent users' need for solutions, enabled by the consumerisation of digital technology, and realized through innovation processes\" (p. 181). Light-weight IT development is how users leverage technology to orchestrate the entangled relations into contextually appropriate assemblages to solve their own needs. Rather than the generic, context and purpose free problems solved by the black boxes of heavyweight IT.</p> <p>These \"light-weight IT\" practices aren't new in universities or learning and teaching. Pre-designed templates for the LMS(Per\u00e4m\u00e4ki, 2021) are an increasingly common, simple example. The common practice within the Canvas community of developing and sharing userscripts or sharing Python code are examples. A more surprising examples is that many Universities have significant enterprise projects in the form of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) (e.g. the University of Melbourne, the Australian National University, Griffith University, and the University of Auckland). RPA is a poster child example of lightweight IT development. These significant enterprise RPA projects are designed to develop the capability to more efficiently and effectively re-entangle the black boxes of enterprise IT. But to date universities appear to be focusing RPA efforts on administrative processes such as HR, Finance, and student enrolment. I'm not aware of any evidence of institutional projects explicitly focused on applying these methods to learning and teaching. Instead, leaving it to us tinkerers.</p> <p>The argument here is that more effective orchestration of entangled relations will be a necessary (though not sufficient) enabler for breaking the iron triangle in learning and teaching. On-going reliance on the black-boxes of heavyweight IT will be a barrier to breaking the iron triangle. A big part of the struggle is that lightweight and heavyweight IT are different socio-technical knowledge regimes (Bygstad, 2017). They have different umwelten and in L&amp;T practice the heavyweight umwelten reigns supreme. Hence, I'm not sure if I'm more worried about the absence of lightweight approaches to L&amp;T at universities, or the nature of the \"lightweight\" approach that universities might develop given their current knowledge regimes.

Echo360 is used in these course sites for lecture capture and for recording and embedding other videos.  Echo360 is an external tool, it's not part of the LMS (Blackboard or Canvas). Instead, the Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) standard is used to embed and link echo360 videos into the LMS. LTI is a way to provide loose coupling between the separate black boxes of the LMS and other tools. It makes it easy for the individual vendors - both LMS and external tools - to develop their own software. They focus on writing software to meet the LTI standard without a need to understand (much of) the internal detail of each other's software. Once done, their software can interconnect (via a very narrow connection). For institutional information technology folk the presence of LTI support in a tool promises to make it easy to connect one piece of software to another. i.e. it makes it easy to connect the Blackboard LMS and Echo360; or, to connect the Canvas LMS and Echo360.</p> <p>From the teacher perspective, one practice LTI enables is a way for an Echo360 button to appear in the LMS content editor.

The ability to provide those statistics is not common, more on that in the next section.</p> <p>The problem we face in migrating these videos to Canvas is that our purpose falls outside the purpose of LTI. Our purpose is not focused on connecting an individual LMS to echo360. We're moving from one LMS to another LMS. LTI is not designed to help with that purpose. LTI's purpose (one LMS to echo360) and how it's been implemented in Blackboard creates a problem for us. The code to embed an echo360 video in Blackboard (via LTI) is different to the code to embed the same video in Canvas (via LTI). If I use Blackboard's Echo360 LTI plugin to embed an echo360 video into Blackboard the id will be f34e8a01-4f72-46e1-XXXX-105XXXXXf75f. If I use the Canvas Echo360 LIT plugin to embed the very same video into Canvas it will use a very different id (49dbc576-XXXX-4eb0-b0d6-6bXXXXX0707).

So either the video owner (typically an academic) or the \"root\" user generate the new ids.

We're working through the prevailing heavyweight umwelt in attempt to move it into production. For now, it's working as a userscript and being used to semi-automate the typical Canvas workaround for creating visual home pages using cards. Further illustrating the flexibility of the light-weight approach and how Canvas Collections was inspired by related approaches within the Canvas Community, including: CSS-based approaches to creating interactive cards; and, Javascript methods for inserting cards into Canvas which appears to have gone into production at the University of Oxford.

Modules can be grouped into collections that align with the design intent of the course. Figures 7 and 8 illustrate a common use of two collections: course content and assessment. A navigation bar is provided to switch between the two collections. When viewing a collection you only see the modules that belong to that collection.</p> </li> <li> <p>Representations; and,</p> <p>Rather than just a text-based list of modules and their contents, collections supports the development of different ways of representing a collection of modules. Figures 7 and 8 demonstrate use of a representation that borrows heavily from the Card Interface. Such representations - implemented in code - can perform additional tasks to further embed context and design intent. </p> </li> <li> <p>Additional module \"meta-data\".</p> <p>Canvas stores a large collection of generic information about Modules for its purposes. However, as you engage in learning design you assign additional information and purpose to modules. The collections abstraction allows you to assign modules for different purposes (e.g. content, assignments, resources for Professional Experience) but may also be useful to assign: a description or driving question to a module to help learners understand the module's intent; a date or date period when learners should pay attention to a module; a different label to a module to further refine its purpose; a picture to ....etc.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Figures 7 and 8 illustrate each of these abstractions. The modules for this sample course have been divided into two collections: Course Content (Figure 7) and Assessment (Figure 8). Perhaps not very creative, but mirroring common organisational practice. Each Canvas module is represented by a card, which includes the title (Canvas), a specific image, a description, relevant dates, and a link to the module. </p> <p>The dates are a further example of injecting context into a generic tool to save time and manual effort. The provision of specific dates (e.g. July 18, Friday, September 2) would require manual updating everytime a course site was rolled over to a new offering (at a new time). Alternatively, Canvas Collections Griffith Cards representation knows both the Griffith University calendar and how Griffith's approach to Canvas course ids specify the study period for a course. This means dates can be specific in a generic study period format (e.g. Week 1, or Friday Week 11) and the representation can figure out the actual date.</p> <p>Not only does Canvas Collections improve the aesthetics of a Canvas course site it improves the findability of information within the course site by making it possible to move explicitly represent the information architecture. Research (Simmunich et al, 2015) suggests that course sites with higher findability lead to increases in student reported self-efficacy and motivation, and a better overall experience. Experience with the Card Interface and early experience with Canvas Collections suggest that it is just not the students which benefit. Being able to improve a course site using Canvas Collections appears to encourage teaching staff to think more explicitly about the design of their course sites.</p> Figure 7: Canvas Collections - content collection Figure 8: Canvas Collections - assessment collection"},{"location":"share/blog/2022/orchestrating-entangled-relations.html#references","title":"References","text":"<p>Bygstad, B.

Use of design systems intends to help design teams document, share, and communicate to make the design process more efficient and effective (MacDonald, 2019). Werle (2021) argues that a key turning point for design systems was an evolution from being libraries of guidelines followed during design practice into libraries of live artifacts that embody those guidelines but could also be used in development.</p> <p>Given the increasing use of web-based systems for networked learning and increased use of design systems to design web-based system it was perhaps only a matter of time before learning design systems were developed. For example, Joyce Seitzinger gave a webinar titled How learning design systems can help scale and accelerate learning design. Tim Klapdoor has shared descriptions of the work his team have been doing on A Learning Design System and later work on Design at scale. Work that links design systems with a content management system that actively helps in designing lessons (learning experiences?) and in turn draws on a library of learning patterns. But as Tim notes, work that has been focused on providing his team of learning designers tools to help them do their job effectively.</p> <p>The library learning patterns from Tim's group don't follow the Alexandrian format outlined in Goodyear (2015). Hence, don't explicitly provide advice covering the pedagogical framework section in Figure 1. One assumes because they have been initially designed to help learning designers - folk generally expected to have some expertise in this area - rather than teachers. However, that absence may still limit the sharing/communicative aspects of design patterns amongst the designers.</p> <p>In my limited experience, I've also not seen any design system that implements fully Werle's (2021) key turning point for design systems. That is, include libraries of live artifacts that can be used in development. At least one example design system provides components for this purpose but they demonstrate the origins of design systems by focusing on user interface design, rather than learning design. This may say more about the limits of my experience. It may be related to the initial work on design systems being focused on helping learning designers engage in educational design.

The challenge for universities is how to sustainably solve this at scale. Consistency and templates are the increasingly common solution. Solutions that tend to be based on a very specific understanding of scale. An understanding that doesn't fit with the broader educational literature on scale. Examining that literature on scale suggests some alternate ways forward, but also some challenges getting there.</p> <p>== The findability problem</p> <p>Students find it difficult to find their way easily and purposefully through the maze of technologies and tasks in contemporary higher education.

As a direct result of our student feedback, we developed Moodle templates in collaboration with campus leaders among the faculty and have had very positive feedback, especially from new faculty.</p> <p>Findability - the ease with which you can find what you need - is important. There is research that found findability to be the only significant predictor of both student motivation and self-efficacy (Simunich et al, 2015; Crews et al, 2017)</p> <p>== The scale problem</p> <p>Higher education's findability problem is entangled with higher education's scale problem with learning and teaching. How do you sustainably improve the quality of learning and teaching across the entire institution? </p> <p>The \"consistency\" discussion has long identified academic freedom as an issue. A comment on Hill's post points to a 2007 blog post reporting on a panelist identifying </p> <p>the cottage model of online course development where the faculty member is responsible for the development of the electronic course content, which leads to an inconsistent student experience More recently, Neil Mosley talks about the struggle universities have \"drawing the line between recommendation and compulsion\" and whether compelling someone to use a template to provide a more consistent student experience \"is an abhorrent curb of their freedom and individual autonomy\"?</p> <p>Academic freedom is one of the reasons most university L&amp;T Centres find themselves using \"elective, selective, and exemplary approaches\" (Bain &amp; Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 12) to influence L&amp;T. Approaches that are unlikely to work at scale (Bain &amp; Zundans-Fraser, 2017; Ellis &amp; Goodyear, 2019). Another challenge is resourcing. While most universities offer design support services the combination of high demand and limited resources mean that many academics are left to their own devices (Bennet, Agostinho &amp; Lockyer, 2017)</p> <p>Which brings us to the practice of consistency, templates, levels of compulsion and scale.</p>"},{"location":"share/blog/2023/consistency-problem.html#templates-consistency-and-the-cookie-cutter","title":"Templates, consistency and the cookie cutter","text":"<p>Consistency and templates are suggests that have spread wide in higher education.

The problem students are facing isn't inconsistency, it's poor design. Consistency may be one way to address this issue, but it's not without its issues.</p> <p>Perhaps the biggest is Hill's point about \"carbon copy course designs\". The core of my long-term (sometimes overly vehement) problem with institutional consistency. Here's a quote from 1996 quoting Mark (1990) on the tensions between standardised systems for production &amp; distribution of courseware and the desire of teachers/designers to be creative and imaginative. Another from 2015 picking up on how the inherent diversity in a field like education significantly increases the tension between consistency and both creativity and optimality and a favourite Dede (2008) quote (first heard in a Gardner Campbell 2009 talk) </p> <p>Educational research strongly suggests that individual learning is as diverse and as complex as bonding, or certainly as eating. Yet theories of learning and philosophies about how to use ICT for instruction tend to treat learning like sleeping, as a simple activity relatively invariant across people, subject areas, and educational objectives. Current, widely used instructional technology applications have less variety in approach than a low-end fast-food restaurant. (p. 58)</p> <p>The aim here is to ponder some widely adopted solutions to this broad problem (templates and design systems). Identify and discuss their strengths and weaknesses and start exploring what might be beyond them. To seek if we're able to address the problems identified in the consistency discussion without forcing learning and teaching into the McDonald's consistency trap.</p>"},{"location":"share/blog/2023/consistency-scale-templates-design-systems-beyond.html#consistency-and-computer-interfaces","title":"Consistency and computer interfaces","text":"<p>Recognition of the importance of consistency in computing can be seen in the early days of the development of Graphical User Interfaces (GUI). Before GUIs the interface used by most software was text only, often command line driven. Somewhat to very complicated to use. Much simpler to design. GUIs shifted this balance. They were much more complicated to design, especially well. But they were much simpler to use and supported more complex tasks, further increasing the design challenge. </p> <p>For me at least, the shift from classroom to online/digital learning and teaching environments echoes this shift.</p> <p></p> <p>Larry Tessler was one of the early pioneers of GUI design. He worked at Xerox PARC where GUIs first emerged. Later he worked with Apple that did much of the early work mainstreaming GUIs. In this interview he describes how the value of consistency was recognised and how it was supported in GUI development. Consistency was seen as a way to benefit both users (improving quality of the GUI and the user experience) and developers (reducing the time and complexity required to develop GUIs). </p> <p>The method for encouraging consistency at Apple in the early 1980s was the development of a generic application. A real program with all the typical features of a GUI (windows, menus, commands etc) but not specific functionality. A GUI developer developed their application by modifying this generic application. </p>"},{"location":"share/blog/2023/consistency-scale-templates-design-systems-beyond.html#templates---generative-or-sterile","title":"Templates - generative or sterile?","text":"<p>Templates are the \"generic application\" of the contemporary digital L&amp;T environment. Per\u00e4m\u00e4ki (2021) positions course templates as a framework for a course site to help the content creator/teacher. In this context, templates benefits are suggested to include reducing teacher workload, improving design decisions, and improving the student experience (Konstantinidis, 2022). Hill et al (2012) focus on templates as partially structured and populated that aid teachers getting started with course site design. In later related work (Fresen et al, 2014) three important assumptions about templates were identified.</p> <ol> <li>A template's role is to suggest, not prescribe.</li> <li>Templates can be mixed and matched, they're not mutually exclusive.</li> <li>Templates should be supported with appropriate help materials, including suggestions for implementation and modification.</li> </ol> <p>All of which very much echoes the generic application approach of Apple in the 1980s. The template provides the starting point for modification, not a carbon copy or cookie cutter. </p> <p>However, not all use of templates in digital L&amp;T take this approach, nor are perceived this way.

In particular, our 10 acre home block. How do I gather and weave in order to augument this new local environment?</p> <p>The need is obvious. Since colonisation at least 40% of Australia's forests have been cleared. Since 2001, losses in South-East Queensland include: 7,384 hectares of remnant vegetation, 54,983 hectares of woody vegetation, and 1,220 hectares of natural wetlands. Our block has evidence of brigalow scrub and other ecosystems but falls within an area that is classified as \"non-remnant\". i.e. it has been heavily thinned, has significant disturbed vegetation, or cleared. Which in our case includes some significant infestation by nasty weeds. For example, the climbing asparagus fern in the following image (in the left photo, not the right) which shows off some of my early work.</p> <p> Evidence of asparagus fern removal</p> <p>There are a lot of people and groups (e.g. this local group I've joined) doing this work. Not surprisingly the purpose, approach and terminology used by these groups varies significantly. As novices our purpose and approach will evolve, but the term \"sustainable restoration\" resonates currently. It's a term attributed to John Lahey describing \"restoration efforts where human input is minimal\". Which speaks to me of bricolage. Sustainable restoration is not a widely used/known term meaning there isn't multiple meanings (often with associated \"thought camps\") as with other terms. That said related terms and movements like restoration, rewilding, and permaculture are of interest. Especially if rewilding is seeking to restore ecosystems so they can look after themselves (Macgilchrist, 2021). But even that sentiment has some difference to ponder.</p>"},{"location":"share/blog/2024/what-now.html#limitations-of-my-current-digital-practices","title":"Limitations of my current digital practices","text":"<p>The digital practices I use in everyday life and to maintain my online presence suffer from a number of limitations.
