Ellis & Goodyear (2019)
- why “most of the effort by L&T centres is directed to a small minority of willing academics” and such “centres are not equipped or motivated to operate strategically, at scale” (Ellis & Goodyear, 2019, p. 202).
- to infrastructures and service interfaces for a manageably small set of particularly valued activity systems (p. 188).
- it is fair to suggest that there is much more to be done to understand and effectively use educational technologies in higher education. (Lodge et al, 2022, p. 4)

### Complexity and simplicity


> Ideas that are intuitive and that reduce a complex reality into a simple heuristic have great appeal, particularly in higher education. (Lodge et al, 2022, p. 3)
> Some (e.g. Teräs et al., 2020) have pointed to consulting firms and technology vendors as nefarious actors who use intuitive notions about learning and technology to make sales. (Lodge et al, 2022, p. 3)

### Difficulty of designing learning

> One hundred years of debate about appropriate evidence and expertise for designing and enhancing education leaves us with a complex problem to overcome. (Lodge et al, 2022, p. 4)
