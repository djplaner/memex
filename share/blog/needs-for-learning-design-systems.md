# Needs for Learning Design Systems

Like many others working in "learning design" roles in higher education
I currently face a problem at work that is being consider
Need/push/interest in adopting more formal approaches to learning design in higher education
_give examples_ Tim, Joyce, ABC learning design 

I'm interested.

But there are different possible concerns driving this interest. This post is an attempt to think about the concerns I've seen mentioned and those that I've observed.  

Aim is to surface and test my reservation. Help think more. Identify different approaches

Feel free to add

## Other takes on understanding or dividing this up

Wasson and Kirschner (2020) refer to 

- their *10 steps to complex learning* as another model for the "needs" (really the tasks) for learning design.
- also mentioning Wasson's (2007) *Design and use of TEL environments*

## Levels

My focus is more on mapping out for me what's required to engage in this task productively as a MLP within higher education.

- Institutional need/purpose
  - Education OR yet another product to sell to make money (or just continue to exist)
- Curriculum design
  - A practice that is currently somewhat disconnected temporarly and be who does it. Hence pointing to a need to bring it together with the following.
  - This diconnection may in fact illustrate the rather arbritary division of this and the next level. Suggesting that the explicit focus on "producing the course profile" much earlier is problematic and/or the course profile not being used elsewhere.
  - Also the question about whether or not a course profile needs the level of difference that the ABC approach might provide
- Learning design 
  - My take on Goodyear's forward oriented design is that when engaged here we should be explicitly thinking about the next level down
  - Wasson and Kirschner (2020) cite the "Scandinavian tradition also recognises a tight relationship between design and use, where one is always designing for a future use situation"
  - This is perhaps where some of the more detail learning design methods (e.g mentioned in Wasson and Kirschner 2020) might fit. They are also illusrative of the difficulty and creative nature of this task.
- Implementation
  - NGDLE/VLE is making this harder and harder
  - Reeves & Lin (2020) argue for design research that sits closer to the teacher, students etc.  This perhaps connects with some of the Ellis and Goodyear (2019) points. The refinement of CASA (specific activity systems) could provide an area in which this type of research is conducted.
  - What enterprise action is paid to implementation tends to be implementation of technologies and generic training in use of those technologies, rather than activity systems. Ellis and Goodyear point to this. **key argument** the institutional stuff only happens at the abstract and generic. Never the specific. Which is also picked up by Wasson and Kirschner (2020) discussion of link with teacher inquiry (TISL).

## Approaches

- Strategic design (long arc)
- Bricolage (short arc)


## Better quality, faster


## It doesn't scale 

## Some people don't design 


## Support services are talking at crossed purposes
