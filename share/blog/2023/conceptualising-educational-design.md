# Conceptualising education design practice - where do we fit?

See also: [[goodyear-patterns-design-practice]]

The first line of the abstract for [Goodyear (2005)](https://ajet.org.au/index.php/AJET/article/view/1344) is
>  There is a growing demand for advice about effective, time efficient ways of using ICT to support student learning in higher education.

Almost 20 years later, with higher education trying to figure out student learning after the emergency pandemic response, that demand seems only more pressing. Certainly the impression from [the THETA'2023 conference](https://ajet.org.au/index.php/AJET/article/view/1344) a couple of weeks ago (amongst all the LLM discussions). [Jason Lodge](https://education.uq.edu.au/profile/2054/jason-lodge) and colleagues presented on work they are doing to build on the work of Goodyear (2005) to inform IT planning, procurement, and evaluation.  Also at THETA, Steven Booten, Henry Cook, and I  [shared our experience](https://djon.es/blog/2023/02/09/gathers-weavers-and-augmenters-three-principles-for-dynamic-and-sustainable-delivery-of-quality-learning-and-teaching/) implementing more effective and time efficient methods for supporting learning and teaching. Deriving principles from that work which can be used more broadly to use digital technologies to support learning and teaching.

The following seeks to explore if and how our work fits with the work of others.

## The educational design problem space, networked learning, and design patterns

Goodyear's (2005) focus is on networked learning. Defined as learning in which digital technologies are used to promote learner-learner, learner-teacher, learning community-resources connections. It is not just putting materials online or distance learning. The central element is the connectedness, not the digital technologies. To be successful, networked learning required effective design. Educational design is defined and distinguished from educational development as follows.

| Term | Definition |
|--------------------|-------------------------|
| educational design | "set of practices involved in constructing representations of how to support learning in particular cases" (Goodyear, 2015, p. 82) |
| educational development | "the practices of turning these representations into support of learning (materials, task specifications, tools, etc)" (Goodyear, 2005, p. 82) |

Expand this (some of the limitations may belong below)

- more models of how to do something than there are accounts of actual design activity
- current design practice tends to focus on aspects and the educational design problem, with few successful examples in networked learning.
- failes to meet the needs of teachers and fails to effectively ??? necessary knowledge

Goodyear critiques much of existing practice about how it fails to meet the needs of teachers and fails to effectively necessary knowledge. In response, he offers a conceptualisation of education design **insert definition** and then offers design patterns as a way to improve educational design. 

	Goes into some details, which I won't do here

_actual practice for teachers_

> - is typically a process extending over a period from a few hours to a small number of days, and involves several iterations around a cycle of articulating design goals (What am I trying to achieve here?) and educational design commitments (What will I ask the students to do? How will I group them? What reading material will they need? etc). Within this process, it is common for the designer to make provisional commitments (How do I know what I think until I see what I’ve designed?) and to backtrack. It’s a fluid process, involving a conversation between the pedagogical beliefs, knowledge and intentions in the mind of the teacherdesigner and (provisional) design commitments. The design commitments are mostly made in the online space: draft instructions for the students, allocation of students to discussion groups or project teams, placing reading lists and links to e-journals in convenient locations, etc. For increasing numbers of teachers in higher education, this iterative design work takes place using a learning management system or virtual learning environment, such as WebCT or Blackboard.

## Structural complexity

Goodyear and Carvalho (2016)
> So the challenge comes from numbers and a structural complexity that arises – in large part – from the freedom that people have to distribute their activity across a wide number of platforms and spaces

Following on from that gather/weave comment, came across the following quote from ⁠[Goodyear & Carvahlo](http://www.networkedlearningconference.org.uk/abstracts/pdf/P16.pdf "http://www.networkedlearningconference.org.uk/abstracts/pdf/P16.pdf"), which is useful in our context.  In particular and from a somewhat technical perspective, this echoes the challenge of moving from the single LMS to the Griffith VLE (i.e. an ecosystem of tools). A shift from the ⁠[integrated approach to a best of breed approach](https://djon.es/blog/2009/08/31/product-models-lms-bob-and-alternatives/ "https://djon.es/blog/2009/08/31/product-models-lms-bob-and-alternatives/") which has literature echoing back to 2001 which identified one of the challenges of this shift - integration of applications is time consuming.   i.e. the structural complexity has increased.

## End structural complexity


The question is, does this approach work?

There was a lot of design patterns work in the mid-noughties. Anecdotally, I've not seen anything like this in action over recent years. It doesn't appear to have entered the mainstream.

Also in 2005, McAndrew, Goodyear and Dalziel (2005) compare design patterns with two other approaches to describing learning tasks/activities. As part of this comparison they identify that what is missing from design patterns is the expertise to implement the design pattern ("to get the pattern into the LMS"). This appears to be a space where our [[gatherers-weavers-augmenters]] and [[casa]] work might help?

Goodyear (2005) mentions the use of patterns by the object-oriented programming (OOPs) crowd as an example of another discipline adopting Alexander's architectural design patterns work. While not universal, design patterns remain fairly widely used by the OOPs community. Much more so than in higher education learning and teaching. Why?

| | OOP | Higher Ed L&T |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Design, develop, maintain | Software applications | L&T environments & activities |
| Practitioner | Primarily OO programmers | Primarily teaching staff |
| Practitioner purpose | OO programming | Research etc, maybe L&T |
| Practitioner expertise | OO programming | Disciplinary, bit of L&T etc |
| Support tools | Integrated development environments | Ad hoc collection of institutional tools with only a few integrated |
| Focus on improving | Developer experience | **Student experience** |

	Perhaps it is because the translation of the design problem into practice/artefact is more straight forward and consistent in OO programming than higher ed L&T. In OO programming, the design pattern the software developer translates it into code (that can be tested etc) using increasingly fairly common integrated development practices and tools.  Knowledge of those practices and tools are seen as fairly central to the expertise of the software developer. Software development itself has quite an explicit focus on improving the developer experience. On the other hand, in higher ed L&T translating a design pattern into a learning environment relies on the complex gathering and weaving of of whatever random collection of physical/digital tools and processes within their individual institution. This complex gathering and weaving is not typically seen as central to the expertise of the practitioner. Often quite the opposite. Also, there is typically no on-going focus on "teacher experience" that echoes the focus on the "developer experience".


- THETA presentation - Henry, Steven and I 
- Jason Lodge and colleagues were wondering how to weave "what we know about learning" into we do and was harking back to Goodyear (2005)
- If/how does our work fit/relate

## Goodyear (2005)

## Lodge (2023)

Random thoughts
- done a lot more expanding out the pedagogical framework
- But perhaps the arrows are too coarse grained
- And the boxes of the various components of LMS are too blackbox - don't represent the entangled nature

But still need to spread it to the teachers and the students
