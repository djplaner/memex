## On usable tools and supporting course design

- Brook's usable tools 
- Goodyear's short arc design - maybe this one goes later
- Perhaps more of a focus on the need for help with design

## On consistency

_Talk about the need_ Make their argument

Original guy - https://twitter.com/Karch10k - look for twitter conversation about consistency
- [[consistency-quality]]
- [[consistency-is-key-in-online-learning]]
- [[lms-freedom-consistency]]

_Mention the need to sell it_ and other perceived issues

Karch10k's need to sell it and get people to adopt - perhaps it's not seen as useful or productive?

## Scaleable education innovations need to scale by being flexible

Dede's argument about scale and diversity, and the need for evolution


## How to fix templates?

Maybe this is where Dron's "small hard tools" -- templates are too big

perhaps back to our principles, framed as questions - maybe the CASA principles

1. How much additional value/functionality does the template provide? How much rework?
2. How much on-going change and reponsiveness is built in? Is it generative?
