Just [over a month ago](https://djon.es/blog/2020/07/06/designing-a-personal-memex-with-foam/) I started exploring the use of [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) as my next attempt at developing a Personal Knowledge Management process. This has evolved into using Foam to curate [my personal "Memex"](https://djplaner.github.io/memex/) and [populating it with](https://djon.es/blog/2020/07/07/getting-started-with-memex/) notes from my experiments with [Smallest Federated Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallest_Federated_Wiki) and [Wikity](https://hapgood.us/2015/12/09/introducing-wikity/).
