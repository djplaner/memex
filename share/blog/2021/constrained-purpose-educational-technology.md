# Problems with the constrained purpose of educational technology

Within Australian higher education, it is fairly hard to design and support an effective university course that includes significant use of digital technology. That's one reason why 

Some people think training teaching staff will help. Training that ranges from formal qualifications in education to one-on-one sessions introducing the latest tool. At some level these will help, but I don't think they are going to significantly reduce the difficulty.

_Why?_ It's asking the individual to take on more of the challenge. Maybe not

Going to explore why

Dron uses Arthurs definition of _technology_ as 
> "the orchestration of phenomena for some purpose"
Dron then defines _educational technology_ as 
> 
Following uses this definition to explore how constraints in the purpose of different educational create problems. In particular, it argues that these constraints create a biggest problems. **reword**

- we have separate technologies, with separate purposes, but an actual learning activity/environment has to orchestrate those technologies to serve a different, more specific purpose and this is where the difficulty arises
- this is made worse because designing and supporting learning tasks (a course) requires an ever-growing list of technologies that need to be orchestrated in order to create a quality learning experience
- and the ever growing push for flexibility and reuse (e.g. micro-credentials) requires the ability to re-orchestrate this vast assemblage of technologies for a different purpose

Above and beyond what the teacher/teaching team is doing the student also has to integrate that with their own technologies for their own purpose


- constructive alignment
- Course profile system
- video editing software
- Blackboard
- Grade management system

- made only harder with the rise of the VLE

Something about the focus on design and implementation and not the rest of Goodyear's forward oriented design.

Grade's as the common technology.

Robot's as a start...but limitations
