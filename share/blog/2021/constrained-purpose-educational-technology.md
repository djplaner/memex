Following uses this definition to explore how constraints in the purpose of different educational create problems. In particular, it argues that these constraints create a biggest problems. **reword**

- we have separate technologies, with separate purposes, but an actual learning activity/environment has to orchestrate those technologies to serve a different, more specific purpose and this is where the difficulty arises

Above and beyond what the teacher/teaching team is doing the student also has to integrate that with their own technologies for their own purpose


- constructive alignment
- Course profile system
- Blackboard
- Grade management system

- made only harder with the rise of the VLE

Grade's as the common technology.
