# Problems with the constrained purpose of educational technologies and their orchestration

For the last couple of months I've been focused on helping with the redesign of a handful of courses. This has taken place in the context of Australian higher education. The following is a reflection on that experience about what was difficult and what could be done better.  In particular, it's become an exploration into an alternative to what @neilmosley5 calls ["the false and simplistic dichotomy"](https://twitter.com/neilmosley5/status/1432766787737817097) of "pedagogy not technology". An alternative that owes a lot to @timbocop's notion of [entangled pedagogy](https://twitter.com/timbocop/status/1426093163035328512) and @jondron's [definition of educational technology](https://twitter.com/jondron/status/1378811228554985474).

The focus of this work has been helping teaching staff - who are largely sessional/casual - engagage effectively in design for learning with the aim of improve learning processes and outcomes through the creation of tasks, environments and social structures conducive to effective learning (Goodyear, 2015). But doing so without the luxury of greenfield re-design. Instead, working with and re-working what's available and possible. But with the explicit focus on improving the tasks, environments and social structures. Work that has been reasonably successful and achieved its goals.

What has been difficult about this work has not been identifying the correct pedagogy, or knowing how to push the right buttons on the relevant technology. Within the context of this project that knowledge was available (it could always be better, but it was more than sufficient for the context). The most difficult part of this work has been orchestrating the diverse technologies (including both pedagogy and technology, see below for more on this) into a learning and teaching environment that is conducive to learning and teaching. i.e. what Tim Fawns' entangled pedagogy perspective views as the important skill, was most difficult. 

Why was this the case?

The argument below is that this is because all of the technologies (administrative, design, pedagogical, digital, etc.) present in our context have purposes that are very constrained, generic, somewhat unmodifiable, and largely stand alone. This combination makes orchestrating these technologies into approproate learning environments and tasks incredibly difficult. A difficult that no amount of skill and knowledge in choosing technologies or in using technologies is able to address. The technologies available make it difficult to engage effectively in design for learning.

## What is educational technology?

Dron uses Arthurs definition of _technology_ as 
> "the orchestration of phenomena for some purpose"
Dron then defines _educational technology_ as 

## Illustrating the difficulty of orchestration

_Maybe just illustrate this with creating course sites. Perhaps with a bit of content_
_Need to focus on the constrained purpposes of the technologies and then show the result_

- constructive alignment
- Course profile system
- video editing software
- Blackboard
- Grade management system

- made only harder with the rise of the VLE

- design and forward oriented design - a view of design focused on one aspect


- we have separate technologies, with separate purposes, but an actual learning activity/environment has to orchestrate those technologies to serve a different, more specific purpose and this is where the difficulty arises
- this is made worse because designing and supporting learning tasks (a course) requires an ever-growing list of technologies that need to be orchestrated in order to create a quality learning experience
- and the ever growing push for flexibility and reuse (e.g. micro-credentials) requires the ability to re-orchestrate this vast assemblage of technologies for a different purpose

Above and beyond what the teacher/teaching team is doing the student also has to integrate that with their own technologies for their own purpose

Robot's as a start...but limitations
