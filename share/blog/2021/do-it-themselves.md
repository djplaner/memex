# "Do it themselves" and technology/purpose mismatch


Mark Smiths makes some points about what he sees as the "sweet" spot distinction between Moodle and Canvas

There may be some that quibble with Mark's categorisation (I tend to agree) but that's not my focus here. Instead I'd like to dig into Mark's practice here of choosing a technology to match the "purpose" for which it is being used. In Mark's case he's suggesting the following alignment:

- Moodle fits better with the "purpose" of "learning designer and specialists work with an SME"
- Canvas fits better with the "purpose" of teaching staff (SMEs) doing all (the majority) of the work


## Related points

- Basic premise is that the technology has to fit your "purpose"
  - Functional evaluation of technology often misses the broader point
  - institutions don't think about the different costs/savings

- e.g. Kevin and the DIY approach to getting rid of DLTS. - print too complex, tech easy enough

- But single systems don't make it easy, largely because they aren't single systems anymore
  - The rationale for enterprise **integrated** systems was easy to use but not longer single systems


- But what if your intitution does a bit of A and a bit of B (my tweet)
- Common solution appears to be seperate org units/OPM and/or separate systems

- CQU have used Moodle for a very specific learning design
  - But Moodle is flexible and with the right people can be modified
