# Consistency: Low floor and low ceiling

For higher education institutions working with an LMS _consistency_ is seen as important. For more detail on the arugment for consistency see ["Freedom and the Learning Management System"](https://www.neilmosley.com/blog/freedom-and-the-lms) from Neil Mosley. **mosley's post**. The institution I currently work for is embarking on an LMS migration. "Consistency projects" are seen as an important part of that migration. I'm part of one of those projects. I'm not a fan of consistency (see **this twitter thread**). I don't think it works.  The following explains what I think consistency gets right, what it gets wrong, and argues for a different approach.

_low hanging fruit tweet quote_

In summary, I think a focus on consistency ends up with learning environments that are the equivalent of a "bad fast-food restaraunt" (see this quote from Dron**link**). To a large extent this is because the results of most consistency projects is a L&T environment that helpfully has a low floor. It makes it easier to do the right thing. But the environment also has a low ceiling. It makes it harder and much less likely that anything more can or will be done. Hence bad fast food. 

***??? question about this point*** My argument is this largely arises because consistency projects are (in my experience) typically based on limited conceptualisation of the task. _content editing rather than design for learning_

## Sequential versus wicked, entangled view; and, ??service versus enabling??

First, some thoughts on the nature of the problem. Consistency projects, almost as a guaranteed characteristic of any "enterprise" solution assumes that this is a simple problem. i.e. you can form a project, perform some analysis, do some design, implement a solution, and that solution will _cause_ the positive outcomes you're looking for. It assumes that there is a solution, which smart people can find and develop. It's the type of view that thinks sequential approaches (e.g. _pedagogy before technology_) are a useful part of developing a solution.

> Developing more effective pedagogies will require new understandings of how digital technology is intertwined within other aspects of the

Doing this orchestration is hard. Consistency projects tend _need to be less strong here_ to assume that solving this is too hard for teachers. Hence someone needs to do it for them. The service model. And perhaps in a perfect world this might be true, but in the real world of higher education the "do it for" model doesn't scale. At least not with out the "bad fastfood restaurant" outcome. In part, because typical universities don't have the resources. But largely because "orchestratiting" (_Fawns language_) is a wicked problem. There is no one solution.

What's required is an enabling view. Practices, methods, tools etc that help with this wicked problem. Enabling with these types of features.

## There's a low floor, but how high is the ceiling and wide the walls?

## Does it help with more than content design? Does it help with design for learning?

Designing a course site is not just content creation. It's also not just implementing a design. How can we help support more of the elements of a [useful theory of design for learning](http://www.researchinlearningtechnology.net/index.php/rlt/article/view/19909)? 

Learning deisgn tools like LAMS helped somewhat with this. But didn't...other features .  Maybe next one

## Does it integrate with other tools, systems and practices?

The "editor" approach typically requires the author to bring content that has already been entered into other systems (e.g. course learning outcomes, assignment details, university dates etc). Wondering if the tools can prevent the need for this duplicate manual data entry?

## Is there value in moving beyond the LMS?

Given the modularity/flexibility has been identified as one of the espoused aims for the migration, how is that served by content creation being tied up in one specific LMS? The Design Tools help improve the content authoring process beyond a typical WYSYWIG editor, but it still doesn't appear to help much with a collaborative, multi-author content creation. (One of the incomplete aims of the Content Interface)

Calls for greater flexibility. i.e. the idea of reusing content from one site to another, one purpose to another. Given the view above I doubt how well this can happen. But it certainly isn't going to be helped by using a WYSYWIG editor to put content into a typical LMS
