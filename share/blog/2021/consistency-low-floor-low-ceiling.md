# Consistency: Low floor and low ceiling

For higher education institutions working with an LMS _consistency_ is seen as important. For more detail on the arugment for consistency see **mosley's post**. The institution I currently work for is embarking on an LMS migration. "Consistency projects" are seen as an important part of that migration. I'm part of one of those projects. I'm not a fan of consistency (see **this twitter thread**). I don't think it works.  The following explains what I think consistency gets right, what it gets wrong, and argues for a different approach.

In summary, I think a focus on consistency ends up with learning environments that are the equivalent of a "bad fast-food restaraunt" (see this quote from Dron**link**). To a large extent this is because the results of most consistency projects is a L&T environment that helpfully has a low floor. It makes it easier to do the right thing. But the environment also has a low ceiling. It makes it harder and much less likely that anything more can or will be done. Hence bad fast food. 

My argument is this largely arises because consistency projects are based on limited conceptualisation of the task. _content editing rather than design for learning_
