Chances are that your university has had, currently has, or will very soon have a _consistency_ project. A project intended to respond to the problem [@neilmosley05](https://twitter.com/neilmosley5) raised in this tweet
https://twitter.com/neilmosley5/status/1446167271039242253

The conversation @neilmosley05's tweet generated provides an illustration of the variety of views about _consistency_. As the title of this post suggests, I'm not a fan. As the title suggests, I think this _consistency_ is a simple to implement "solution" that fails to recognise or engage with the real complexity of the problem.

This post attempts to explain that perspective drawing on perspectives from the Twitter conversation. To identify the limitations of _consistency_. To explain some alternate conceptualisations of the problem and explore some different ways of responding to the problem.

## The limitations of _consistency_

One of the standard problems raised to support the need for consistency is that students can't find anything on their course sites. @gamerlearner mentions this very real problem

Sure making every course use the same language in the same place would be one way to improve findability. Another would be to provide an effective search engine. I've yet to work at a University that provide a search engine (effective or not) for content in course sites.

The implicit assumption underpinning the _consistency_ argument appears to be that _consistency_ will generate good quality. A point @econproph makes

Suggesting that a consistent _quality of design_, rather than _consistency_ might have some value. @todd_conways puts it sucinctly

Templates have long been used as an enabler of _consistency_ and as a way to reuse design knowledge. For example, in pre-Web hypermedia (Nanard, Nanard & Khan, 1998). In the context of this discussion,  @judith_ekn shares her experience with templates

Back in the early 1990s, when Australian higher education included large populations of students studying via print-based distance education, there was another method of achieving consistency. Industrial level print-based education organisations would take text provided by teachers and teams of project managers, instructional designers, desktop publishers, copy editors, and printers would transform that text into print-based study material that adhered to strictly consistent design standards. Dekkers and Kemp (1995) provide an example.

The assumption is if every site is consistent - by whatever means - that students will find what they need and their learning experience will be improved.

If that's the case, then what's your experience with University websites? Always able to find what you need? Delighted by what you find?

Over the last decade (or so), Australian University websites have become bastions of marketing enforced consistency. Control of the institutional website resides with marketing. The almight institutional brand defines the standard for consistency. Industrial strength content management systems have been adopted to ensure that consistency. Authoring access is limited to a small number of people who have been initiated into the brand. 

The institutional websites of Australian Universities appear to be the best available examples of achieving consistency. But as staff member, parent of prospective students, and occasional researcher I find them to be devoid of specific, timely, and useful content or services. What content and services are provided are the lowest 

Consistency and the brand rules all

?? something about templates and their limitations - this is where the unversity website comes in??
