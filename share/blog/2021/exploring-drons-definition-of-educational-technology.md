There's wide acceptance that educational technology - in particular, digital technology - was essential to enabling higher education across the world to respond to all that was 2020. Common experience also seems to be that most of that response was not that great. There was some good work, there was a lot of a "good enough for the context" work, but there remained a significant proportion of the work that really sucked.

This is not all that surprising. Obviously a rapid transformation made whilst responding to a pandemic was never going be our best work. There just wasn't time to engage in significant questioning of current assumptions and practices to develop effective, context specific responses. Especially when most pre-2020 individual and organisational assumptions and practices around learning, teaching and technology were built on fairly limited conceptual foundations. As individuals, institutions, and [vendors](https://edublog.microsoft.com/en-au/2021/02/higher-ed-reimagined-navigating-the-three-rs-to-build-agility-and-resilience/) (thanks Microsoft?) being to (re-)imagine what's next for learning and teaching in higher education, now is probably a good time to explore and improve those faily limited conceptual foundations.

The following is my attempt to explore and understand [Dron's (2021)](https://jondron.ca/my-latest-paper-educational-technology-what-it-is-and-how-it-works/) definition of educational technology and how it works. It starts with giving a common practical example of an educational context which I think use to apply Dron's definition. It finishes with a quick look at if and how Dron's definition might be have useful implications for the assumptions and practices that I see everyday from practitioners, researchers and leaders. 

Would be interesting in hearing alternate thoughts on Dron's definition and the implications I've drawn from it.

## A practical learning and teaching example

Imagine you're responsible for running a tutorial for a course. You've just rocked up to the tutorial room for the first time and you're looking at one of the following room layouts. How does Dron's definition of educational technology help analyse the learning and teaching activity and experience you and your students are about to embark upon? How might it help students, teachers, and the people from facilities management and your institution's learning and teaching centre.

Before going any further, it might help
What is the technology in this room? What can/will you all do with it? What knowledge do you need? What insights can it provide the people responsible for designing the room? What about the people responsible for learning and teaching?

### What is the (educational) technology in the room?

If you were asked to list all the technology you see in the images above, what would be on your list?

A typical list might include chairs, tables, computers, whiteboards (interactive/smart and static), clock, notice boards, doors, windows, walls, floors, cupboards, water bottles, phones, books, notepads etc.

Now imagine that the images show you, your students and your tutorial in full flow. Does this change your list of the technolgy you see in the room? How?

Maybe you add more of the technologies that you and your students brought with you. Laptops, phones, backpacks etc. What else?

How do you delineate between what is and isn't technology? How would you define technology?
### What if we use Dron's definition of (educational) technology?

Dron (2021) starts by acknowledging that defining technology is hard. One of the reasons for our vague and often contradictory understanding of the term. Dron builds his work on Arthur's (2009) definition of technology as
> the orchestration of phenomena for some purpose (Arthur, 2009, p. 51)

The phenomena harnessed by technology includes stuff that is "real or imagined, mental or physical, designed or existing in the natural world" (Dron, 2021, p. 2). The furniture in the images above harness physical and material phenomena. Electricity is harnessed by a variety of the technologies in the images above. In the right hand image above - and in your imagined use of the rooms for your tutorial - various mental phenemona are being harnessed to read, write and speak. In this definition, language and certain mental processes are technologies. An extrapolation of this is that **pedagogies are a type of technology**.

With Arthur's definition, the teaching activity illustrated in the image above is a type of technology and should be added to your list of technologies.

### What is educational technology?

This leads to Dron's (2021) argument that
> educational technology, or learning technology, may tentatively be defined as one that, deliberately or not, includes pedagogies among the technologies it orchestrates.

Arguably, following from this both the images above are examples of educational technologies. The inclusion of pedagogies in the image of an empty classroom is somewhat more implicit than in the image of the classroom being used. I'd argue that the empty classroom implicitly illustrates some teacher-driven pedagogical assumptions in terms of how it is laid out. Teacher-driven pedagogical assumptions that are more explicitly obvious in the image where teaching is taking place.

In part, this is also because the purpose to which these rooms serve is much more explicit in the image where teaching is taking place. Not only because you can see the teacher up the front and the students apparently following along. But also because the teacher-driven pedagogical assumptions are a more fixed in the image where teaching is taking place. The desks in that image aren't designed to be moved. The seating positions for students is almost always going to be facing toward the teacher at the front of the room. There are even partitions between each student making collaboration and sharing more difficult.

The room on the right is much more flexible and potentially implicitly embodies a number of different pedagogical assumptions. The chairs and tables can be moved. They could be pushed to sides of the room to open up a space for all sorts of large group and collaborative pedagogies. The shapes of the desks suggest that it would be possible to push four of them together to support small group pedagogies. Pedagogies that seek to harness a very different set of mental and learning phenomena.

### Hard and soft technologies


### Assembly

### Coparticipants, not just users

### Hard is easy, soft is hard

## A shopping list of possible applications and implications

[Dron (2021)](https://jondron.ca/my-latest-paper-educational-technology-what-it-is-and-how-it-works/) applies his definition of educational technology to some of the big educational research questions including: the no significant different phenomena; learning styles; and the impossibility of replication studies for educational interventions. The following is an ad hoc shopping list of applications of his definition to my practitioner experience with educational technology within Australian Higher Education. It's more a list of questionable possibilities to explore further than anything firmly held to be correct.

### Soft, hard, the difficulty and constraint of assembly

A path dependent future

- Digital platforms seek to limit/control assembly
- Being of the Web is better for assembly
