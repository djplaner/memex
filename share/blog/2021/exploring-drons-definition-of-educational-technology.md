Pre-COVID the role of technology in learning and teaching in higher education was important. During COVID it became core to enabling any continuation of L&T.  But, it seems most of that response was not that great. There was some good work. There was a lot of a "good enough for the situation" work. There was quite a bit that really sucked.

![Drake Hotline Bling Meme](images/privacy_proctoring.png)

Arugably, not that different from pre-COVID practice. The main difference being that during COVID the overall use of digital technology was by necessity larger. Rapid adoption whilst responding to a pandemic was never going be better. There just wasn't time to engage in significant questioning of current assumptions and redesign of prior practices to suit different context and needs.

Especially when, as I'd argue, most pre-2020 individual and organisational assumptions and practices around learning, teaching and technology were built on fairly limited conceptual foundations. As individuals, institutions, and [vendors](https://edublog.microsoft.com/en-au/2021/02/higher-ed-reimagined-navigating-the-three-rs-to-build-agility-and-resilience/) (thanks Microsoft?) begin to (re-)imagine what's next for learning and teaching in higher education, now is probably a good time to explore and improve those limited conceptual foundations.

The following is an attempt to understand and apply [Dron's (2021)](https://jondron.ca/my-latest-paper-educational-technology-what-it-is-and-how-it-works/) definition of educational technology and how it works. It is a definition that resonates with my experience and background and I wonder what value it might have in practice?

## Analysing a tutorial room

Imagine you're responsible for running a tutorial. You've rocked up to the tutorial room for the first time and you're looking at one of the following room layouts: computer lab, or classroom. How does Dron's definition of educational technology help understand the learning and teaching activity and experience you and your students are about to embark upon? How might it help students, teachers, and the people from facilities management and your institution's learning and teaching centre?

Before going further, how would you answer these questions

1. What technology do you see in the rooms above (imagine you can see a tutorial being run in both)?
2. What is the nature of the work you and your students do during the tutorial?
3. Which of the rooms above would be "best" for your tutorial? Why?
4. How could the rooms above be modified to be better for tutorials? Why?

### What is the (educational) technology in the room?

Assuming we're looking at a tutorial being carried out in both images. What would be on your list of technology being used?

A typical list might include chairs, tables, computers, whiteboards (interactive/smart and static), clock, notice boards, doors, windows, walls, floors, cupboards, water bottles, phones, books, notepads etc.

Maybe you add more of the technologies that you and your students brought with you. Laptops, phones, backpacks etc. What else?

How do you delineate between what is and isn't technology? How would you define technology?

### Defining technology

Dron (2021) starts by acknowledging that defining technology is hard. That most definitions are vague, incomplete, and often contradictory. Dron uses [Arthur's (2009)](http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~wbarthur/thenatureoftechnology.htm) definition of technlogy as (emphasis added)
> the **orchestration** of **phenomena** for some **purpose** (Dron, 2021, p. 1)

Arthur defines phenomena as including stuff that is "real or imagined, mental or physical, designed or existing in the natural world" (Dron, 2021, p. 2). Phenomena can be drawn from physics (materials science for table tops), biology (human body climate requirements), chemistry etc. The phenomena can be something you touch (the book you hold), a cognitive practice (reading), or partially or entirely human enacted (think/pair/share, organisational processes).

For Arthur, technological evolution comes from combining technologies. The phenomena being orchestrated in a technology can be another technology. Writing orchestrates language for another purpose. A purpose [Socrates didn't much care for](https://newlearningonline.com/literacies/chapter-1/socrates-on-the-forgetfulness-that-comes-with-writing). Different combinations (assemblies) of technologies can be used for different purposes. New technologies are built using assemblies of existing technologies. There are inter-connected webs of technologies orchestrated by different people for different purposes.

For example, in the images above manufacturers of furniture orchestrated various physical and material phenomena to produce the chairs, desks and other furniture. Some other people from institutional facilities management orchestrated different combinations of furniture for the purpose of designing cost efficieent and useful tutorial rooms. The folk designing the computer lab had a different purpose (provide computer lab with desktop computers) than the folk designing the classroom (a more flexible room setup). Those different purposes led to decisions about different approaches to orchestration of different phenomena.

When the tutorial participants enter the room they start the next stage of orchestration for different, more learning and teaching specific purposes. Both students and teachers will have individual purposes in mind. Purposes that may change in respone to what happens in the tutorial. Those diverse purposes will drive them to orchestrate different phenomena in different ways. To achieve a particular learning outcome, a teacher will orchestrate different phenomena and technology. They will combine the technologies in the room with certain pedagogies to create specific learning tasks. The students then orchestrate how the learning tasks - purposeful orchestrations of phenomena - are integrated into their individual purposes.

For Arthur and Dron, **pedagogies are a technology** and **education is a technology**.

![Them's fighting words](images/2021-05-01-13-18-26.png)

Some assemblies of technologies are easier to orchestrate than others. Collaborative small group pedagogies would probably be easier in the classroom, than the computer lab. The design of the furniture technology in the classroom has been orchestrated with the purpose of enabling this type of flexibility. Not so the computer lab.

### What is educational technology?

To answer "what is educational technology?", Dron (2021) suggests
> educational technology, or learning technology, may tentatively be defined as one that, deliberately or not, includes pedagogies among the technologies it orchestrates.

Arguably, following from this both the images above are examples of educational technologies. The inclusion of pedagogies in the empty classroom is more implicit than in the computer lab which shows people apparently engaged in a learning activity. The empty classroom implicitly illustrates some teacher-driven pedagogical assumptions in terms of how it is laid out. With the chairs and desks essentially in rows facing front.

The teacher-driven pedagogical assumptions in the computer lab is more explicit and fixed. Not only because you can see the teacher up the front and the students apparently following along. But also because the teacher-driven pedagogical assumptions are enshrined in the computer lab. The rows in the computer lab are not designed to be moved. The seating positions for students is almost always going to be facing toward the teacher at the front of the room. There are even partitions between each student making collaboration and sharing more difficult.

The classroom, however, is more flexible. It implicitly enables a number of different pedagogical assumptions. A number of different orchetrations of different phenomena. The chairs and tables can be moved. They could be pushed to sides of the room to open up a space for all sorts of large group and collaborative pedagogies. The shapes of the desks suggest that it would be possible to push four of them together to support small group pedagogies. Pedagogies that seek to assemble or orchestrate a very different set of mental and learning phenomena. The classroom is designed to be assembled in different ways.

But beyond that both rooms appear embedded in the broader assembly of technology of formal education. They appear to be classrooms within the buildings of an educational institution. Use of these classrooms are likely scheduled according to a time-table. Scheduled classes are likely led by people employed according to specific position titles and role descriptions. Most of which are likely to make some mention of pedagogies (e.g. lecturer, tutor, teacher).

### Technologies mediate all formal education and intentional learning

Dron's (2021) position is that 
> All teachers use technologies, and technologies mediate all formal education (p. 2)

Everyone involved in education has to be involved in the orchestration of new assemblies of technology. e.g. as you enter one of the rooms above as the teacher, you will orchestrate the available technologies **including** your choice of explicit/implicit pedagogical approaches into a learning experience. If you enter one of the rooms as the learner, you will orchestrate the assembly presented to you by the teacher and institution with your technologies, for your purpose.

Dron does distinguish between learning and intentional learning. Learning is natural. It occurs without explicit orchestration of phenomena for a purpose. He suggests that babies and non-human entities engage in this type of learning. But when we start engaging in intentional learning we start orchestrating assemblies of phenomena/technologies for that purpose. Technologies such as language, writing, concepts, models, theories etc.

### Use and particpation: hard and soft 

For Dron (2021) students and teachers are "not just _users_ but _participants_ in the orchestration of technologies" (p. 3). The technology that is the tutorial you are running, requires participation from **both** you and the students. For example, to help organise the room for particular activities, use the whiteboard/projector to show relevant task information, use language to share a particular message, and use digital or physical notebooks etc. Individuals perform these tasks in different ways, with lesser or greater success, with different definitions of what is required, and with different preferences. They don't just use the technology, the participate in the orchestration.

Some technologies heavily pre-deterimine and restrict what form that participation takes. For example, the rigidity of the seating arrangements in the computer lab image above.  There is very limited capacity to creatively orchestrate the seating arrangement in the computer lab. The students participation is largely (but not entirely) limited to sitting in rows.  The constraints this type of technology places on our behaviour leads Dron to label them as **hard** technologies. But even hard technologies can orchestrated in different ways by coparticipants. Which in turn lead to different orchestrations.

![](images/computerLabRules.png)

Other technologies allow and perhaps require more active and creative orchestration. As mentioned above, the classroom image includes seating that can be creatively arranged in different ways. It is a **soft** technology. Soft technology allows, perhaps even requires, additional knowledge, processes and techniques (i.e additional technology) to be useful. Dron (2021) identifies "teaching methods, musical instruments and computers" as further examples of soft technologies. Technologies that require more from us in terms of orchestration.

### Hard is easy, soft is hard

Hard technologies typically don't require additional knowledge, processes and techniques to achieve their intended purpose. What participation hard technologies require is constrained and (hopefully) fairly obvious. Hard technologies are typically easy to use. However, the intended purpose baked into the hard technology may not align with your purpose.

Soft technologies require additional knowledge, processes and techniques to be useful. The more you know the more creatively you can orchestrate them. Soft technologies are hard to use because they require more of you. However, the upside is that there is often more flexibility in the purpose you can achieve with soft technologies. 

For example, let's assume you want to paint a picture. The following images show two technologies that could help you achieve that purpose. One is hard and one is soft.

| Hard is easy |  Soft is hard |
| --- | --- |
|![](images/paintByNumbers.png) | ![](blankCanvas.png) |
|[Aleksander Fedyanin](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:%D0%9A%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%8B_%D0%BF%D0%BE_%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC.jpg), [CC0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/), via Wikimedia Commons | [Small easel with a blank canvas](https://www.publicdomainpictures.net/en/view-image.php?image=62975&picture=small-easel-with-a-blank-canvas), [CC0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)   |

Softness is not universally available. It can only be used if you have the awareness, permission, knowledge, and self-efficacy necessary to make use of it. Since I "know" I "can't paint", I'd almost certainly never even think of using of a blank canvas. But then if I'm painting by numbers, then I'm stuck with producing whatever painting has been embedded in this hard technology.

As a brand new tutor entering the classroom shown above, you may not feel confident enough to re-arrange the chairs. You may also not be aware of certain beneficial learning activites that require moving the chairs. If you've never taught a particular tutorial or topic with a particular collection of students, you may not be aware that different orchestrations of technologies may be required.

### Hard technologies are first and structural

Harder technologies are structural. They funnel practice two certain types of softer technologies and make it difficult/impossible to use other softer technologies. The structure baked into the hard technology of the computer lab above makes it difficult to use [a circle of voices](https://www.ufs.ac.za/sasse/classe-home/unlisted-pages/ideas/idea-18-circle-of-voices) activity. The structure created by hard technologies may mean you have to consider a different soft technology. For this reason, consideration of the hard technologies comes first. If only to figure out how to work around the constraints.

This can be difficult because hard technologies become part of the furniture. They become implicit, invisible and even apparently natural parts of education. The hardness of the computer lab above is quite obvious, especially the first time you enter the room for a tutorial. But what about the other invisible hard technologies. For example, that you employed to run a tutorial. A technology that is understood to run for one hour, should come after the lecture, and includes certain disciplinary common activities. Features that create a certain structure to follow.

You assemble the tutorial within a web of other technologies. As the number of hard technologies and interconnections between hard technologies increases, the web in which you're working becomes harder to change. Various policies, requirements and decisions are made before you start assembling the tutorial. You might be a casual paid for 1 hour to take a tutorial in the computer lab shown above on Friday at 5pm. You might be required to use a common, pre-determined set of topics/questions. To ensure a common learning experience for students across all tutorials you might be required to use a specific pedagogical approach.

### Education is a coparticipative technological process

For Dron (2021) education is a coparticipative technological process. Education - as a technology - is a complex orchestration of different nested phenomena for diverse purposes. How it is orchestrated and for what purposes are inherently situated, socially constructed, and ungeneralizable. While the most obvious coparticipants in education are students and teachers there are many others. Dron (2021) provides a sample, including "timetablers, writers, editors, illustrators of textbooks, creators of regulations, designers of classrooms, whiteboard manufacturers, developers and managers of LMSs, lab technicians". Some of a never ending list of roles that orchestrate some of the phenomena that make up the technologies that teachers and students then orchestrate to achieve their diverse purposes.

Dron (2021) argues that how the coparticipants orchestrate the technologies is what is important. That the technologies of education - pedagogies, digital technologies, rooms, policies, etc. - "have no value at all without how we creatively and responsively orchestrate them, fuelled by passion for the subject and process, and compassion for our coparticipants" (p. 10). Our coparticipative orchestration is the source of the human, socially constructed, complex and unique processes and outcomes of learning. More than this Dron (2021) argues that the purpose of education is to **both** develop our knowledge and skills **and** to encourge the never-ending development of our ability to assemble our knowledge and skills "to contribute more and gain more from our communities and environments" (p. 10)

Though, as a coparticipant in this technological process, I assume I could orchestrate that particular technology with other phenemona to achieve a different purpose. e.g. if I were a particular type of ed-tech bro profit might be my purpose of choice.

## Possible questions, applications, and implications

[Dron (2021)](https://jondron.ca/my-latest-paper-educational-technology-what-it-is-and-how-it-works/) applies his definition of educational technology to some of the big educational research questions including: the no significant different phenomena; learning styles; and the impossibility of replication studies for educational interventions. The following is an ad hoc list of questions, applications, and implications arising from his definition to my practitioner experience with educational technology within Australian Higher Education. A list for further consideration.


### Important questions: purpose, orchestration, and phenomena

Given Dron's definition of technology 
> the orchestration of phenomena for some purpose (Arthur, 2009, p. 51)
and his positioning of education as a participative technological process, what then are some important questions for practitioners in education arising from Dron's conception?  

Pulling apart the definition seems to suggest

1. Purpose: whose purpose and what is the purpose?
2. Orchestration: how can orchestration happen and who is able orchestrate?
3. Phenomena: what phenomena/assemblies are they orchestration?

My quick reflection on my experience is that too much of what is done to help learning and teaching is focused on the phenomena and not enough on the orchestration and purpose. Echoing my recollections of discussion in Ellis and Goodyear (2019) where the functional areas of a university - learning & teaching; information technology; and, facilitiates management - have a focus on specific different phenemona but see challenges in meaningfully orchestrating those phenomena. Where institutions consider orchestration it is usually to develop "outcome measures at the expense of understanding the proceses that generate those outcomes" (Ellis and Goodyear 2019, p. 2).

### Is the main problem the purpose of contemporary universities?

[Mark Johnson's answer](https://postpandemicuniversity.net/2021/04/05/technology-and-conversation/) to the question "Why don't your Zoom lectures Dance?" isn't a critique of Zoom. He doesn't critique what most see as the technology in a Zoom lecture. Instead he looks at the orchestrated assembly within which this technological object is used. He focuses on the technology (aka orchestrated assembly) that is the Unviersity.

His argument is that the _purpose_ to which various _phenomena_ are being _orchestrated_ to create the technology of a Unviersity is the problem. He describes the current problematic purpose of contemporary unviersities as the "transactional 'delivery of learning' and its measurement" and to "make profits and pay vice-chancellors obscene salaries". He suggests that is the purpose of this particular technology was "creating the contexts for new conversations" is needed to really make your Zoom lectures dance.

Arthur's (2009) conceptualisation of technology and Dron's (2021) definition of educational technology aren't used in Johnson's argument. But it is does seem that there is some resonance.

I don't know many people who are in a position to change the purpose of a university. Suggested you have to live with it, or move outside the university. Living with it perhaps doesn't mean blindly accepting it. If education is a coparticipative technological process, then perhaps living with it could include engaging in different acts of orchestration to assemble the university technology for more interesting purposes?

### Exam proctoring software as a symptom of an older purpose mismatch (and more)

Last week I listened to [this episode](https://teachlabpodcast.com/episodes/failure-to-disrupt-book-club-with-antero-garcia-s1!da6aa) of the [TeachLab podcast](https://teachlabpodcasts.com). It includes discussion of the dangers of exam proctoring software. Discussion included mention of how exam proctoring software assumes that students are cheaters and how that is not the message many teachers wish to send.

### Focus on assembly and fit for (whose) purpose, rather than pedagogy before technology?

Dron argues for viewing education as "a coparticipative technological processes" and that such a conceptualisation is profound.

It's the ability to engage in orchestrations that are important, but which are linked to individual purposes.  But it's also how the pedagogical and the technology and the ??? are orchestrated.  Not enough attention paid there.

**Old stuff below here in this section**

I don't ever seem myself being in a position to change the purpose of higher education, but I do think Arthur, Dron and Johnson are onto a useful way of understanding how to influence the quality of learning and teaching at a practitioner level. That is to eschew less than helpful arguments about precedence between pedagogy and technology (see [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22pedagogy+before+technology%22)). Instead focus on something along the lines of how easy it is for students and teachers to assemble technologies for their purposes.

Educationalists have been quite rightly arguing against technological "silver bullets" to education for quite some time. As argued above, a single technological object (e.g. Microsoft Teams, O365, Blackboard Ultra etc.) is not what matters. The problem for the "pedagogy before technology" folk is that (depending on your definition) pedagogy is just another technological object. The quality of a learning and teaching experience will most influenced about how well the participants in that experience are able to assemble the necessary technologies to achieve their collective and individual purpose(s).

### Common hard assemblies as a barrier?

All universities appear to already have a common set of core learning and teaching assemblies: lectures, tutorials, workshops, assignments, exams, course sites etc. These common assemblies are well understood within universities. Most participants in higher education quickly form an understanding of the types of orchestrations they are expected to perform within these assemblies. These assemblies are difficult to change because they are enmeshed in interconnected webs of different technologies. Position titles (lecturer, tutor), time-tabling, workload allocation, enterprise bargaining agreements, room design, accreditation requirements of governments and professional bodies, and many more all work to enshrine these technologies as "the way we do things around here".

Isn't any surprise that during the rapid COVID response the most common questions were: How do I move my (lecture|tutorial|final exam) online?

These common hard assemblies appear to be barriers to change. Can far-reaching changes in pedagogical practice occur without changing these hard assemblies? Will mandating that all academic staff must have formal pedagogical credentials change these hard assemblies?

### Universities are trying to use the same assemblies

All those existing hard assemblies surrounding learning and teaching were orchestrated into being to support face-to-face learning and teaching. Part of the challenge now is that those assemblies arguably don't work as effectively for significant uses of digital technology. Digital technology is a new phenomena (technology) that the University technology is trying to use. It works differently to face-to-face technology. Different technologies as different phenomena create and foreclose different different opportunities (Zuboff, 1985). Different technologies have different affordances. Different technologies enable and perhaps enable different types of orchestration and produce different types of assembly.

Evidence for this difference is visible in the history for Australian higher education where there have been universities that were on-campus only, primarily print-based distance education, dual mode, and primarily online.
### The LMS is both too soft (difficult) and too hard

The LMS is not a single technology. It contains multiple tools - discussion board, gradebook, content authoring etc - that can be assembled in many different ways. In most institutions that I'm aware of a course site within the Learning Management Systems is a mixture technologies that are both too hard and too soft. Some of this distinction is baked into the LMS, some of it is enshrined by institutional practice and policy.  

For example, most LMS ensure that only authorised people are able to access a course site. Institutional policy determines specifically who is authorised. Hard limitations that can make it difficult to assemble open educational practices. 

An LMS can also come with its equivalent to a blank canvas, a very soft technology. Below is an image of a blank Blackboard Content Area. The blank canvas where a teacher is expected to create a wonderful learning and teaching experience. Exactly what they do is entirely up to them and their knowledge of learning, teaching, Blackboard, web design and other technical knowledge. It's hard. Not many academics have the necessary knowledge. That's why there are so many [ugly](https://djon.es/blog/2019/01/30/improving-reuse-of-design-knowledge-in-a-lms/#the-initial-problem-ugly-text), badly designed LMS course sites, and a tendency for academics to use the LMS as a content repository for PowerPoints, Word docs, and PDF files (Bartuskova et al., 2015).

### Using assemblies to make the soft (difficult) hard (easy) and the hard soft

Dron (2021) points out that hard technologies can be made soft, and soft technologies can be made hard by orchestrating them into other assemblies. For example, a previous institution had the practice of creating different course sites for different offerings of a course. Meaning that students in each offering were starting from a clean slate. Any [residue of experience](https://djon.es/blog/2014/08/15/joining-the-swarm-what-a-course-might-be/#evaporating-residue-of-their-experiences) (Riel and Polin, 2004) from earlier offerings is lost. In [this example](https://djon.es/blog/2014/08/15/joining-the-swarm-what-a-course-might-be/#some-examples-of-the-residue-of-experience) the LMS-based course site was orchestrated into a broader assembly of technologies that includes an external social bookmarking and annotation tool (Diigo). Softening the LMS and enabling some development of a shared residue of experience.

Most universities seek to harden the soft (make the difficult, easier) technology of a LMS site through the development of a institutional standard course shell/look and feel. A specific assembly of features that provide a consistent set of features across all courses with the ultimate aim of increase the quality of the learner experience while reducing the workload required to provide it. In what many see as the best scenario course development is not done by the teacher, but instead course development is orchestrated into a broader assembly that includes on a team of people with expertise in content, learning design, and technology that use a systematic design process to develop the course.

But these resulting assemblies (technologies) then have limitations that then lead to different types of assemblies. Generic default course sites suffer from the [[reusability-paradox]]

Walsh et al (2020) as an example of a very specific type of assembly that is being used to produce high quality learning experieences.  Public/private with very specific/different teams - unbundling - but as perhaps the worst example of what Johnson is talking about. Raisign questions of how normal unviersities can achieve this and enable the sspace for the conversations that Johnson talks about. Perhaps the shared assmebly/CASA approach can work here. With a focus on conversations and on generativity

### The difficulty of scale

Resort of project maanagement and hard technologies


## some ways forward

### An abstract structure

- Purpose and orchestration over Pedagogy before technology
  - P before T is the start of hurtful decomposition
  - It lends itself to the type of instrumentalism that the neo-liberal corporate approach to education loves - the generalisation stuff that Dron talks about
    - It separates things that should be separated: p into their sections and t in theirs
    - those separations start becoming the purpose of the people behind them
      - Hence "project/product manager" roles
      - But also a focus on hardening specific pedagogies
      - But also the idea of abstract standards (perhaps)
    - Hard versus soft would be a better separation
    - 
  - Ignores the value of purpose and orchestration
    - If purpose is seen as specific context/discipline allows greater concentration on the specific activity
    - Better values Dron's contigent, local, contextual etc view of education (or at least is more likely)

  - Underestimating the cost and difficulty of orchestration & need for re-assembly
    - Transformation from harnessing one set of phenomena to another (e.g. f-t-f to online; print to online) potentially requires the orchestration of entirely new assemblies of technologies across the institution
      - Not just teachers, but beyond
      - e.g. the IS conceptions of what's required from IT support
    - It's not just as simple as providing minimal standards
    - Raise questions about the validity of best practice and bench marking??

  - Examining different types of orchestration and assemblies
    - Swinburne public/private, GO/DDCE, acadmeics + ad hoc meso-level practitioenrs
    - What about the idea of focused orchestration of generative assemblages??

### Some practical issues

- pedagogy before technology
- Technologies that don't allow assemblies  
  - Stream doesn't allow download of videos
  - Sway doesn't allow embedding of non-Microsoft approved embeds
- Learning analytics dashboards versus SRES/OnTask type tools - automate versus informate


#### Lecture as hard technology, versus study guide

Orchestration from the students perspective

[Article from conversation](https://theconversation.com/good-riddance-to-boring-lectures-technology-isnt-the-answer-understanding-good-teaching-is-158217?) titled "Good riddance to boring lectures: Technology isn't the answer - understanding good teacing is" is at first glance a good candidate for unpicking

- Suggests that "understanding good teaching is" the answer
  - But this brings up the question of purpose - teaching, rather than learning
  - But that doesn't mean it should be wishy-washy learner focused, it needs to be focused on both, because education is a participatiatory technology orchestration
- Doesn't recognise the lecture as a technology
- Also appears to be an example of "technology first" sticking with the idea of the specific assumption of all being in the room at the same time
