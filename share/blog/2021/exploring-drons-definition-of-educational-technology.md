There's wide acceptance that educational technology - in particular, digital technology - was essential to enabling higher education across the world to respond to all that was 2020. Common experience also seems to be that most of that response was not that great. There was some good work, there was a lot of a "good enough for the context" work, but there remained a significant proportion of the work that really sucked.

This is not all that surprising. Obviously a rapid transformation made whilst responding to a pandemic was never going be our best work. There just wasn't time to engage in significant questioning of current assumptions and practices to develop effective, context specific responses. Especially when most pre-2020 individual and organisational assumptions and practices around learning, teaching and technology were built on fairly limited conceptual foundations. As individuals, institutions, and [vendors](https://edublog.microsoft.com/en-au/2021/02/higher-ed-reimagined-navigating-the-three-rs-to-build-agility-and-resilience/) (thanks Microsoft?) being to (re-)imagine what's next for learning and teaching in higher education, now is probably a good time to explore and improve those faily limited conceptual foundations.

The following is my attempt to explore and understand Dron's (2021) definition of educational technology and how it works. It starts with giving a common practical example of an educational context which I think use to apply Dron's definition. It finishes with a quick look at if and how Dron's definition might be have useful implications for the assumptions and practices that I see everyday from practitioners, researchers and leaders. 

## A practical learning and teaching example

Imagine you're responsible for running a tutorial for a course. You've just rocked up to the tutorial room for the first time and you're looking at one of the following room layouts. How does Dron's definition of educational technology help analyse the learning and teaching activity and experience you and your students are about to embark upon? How might it help students, teachers, and the people from facilities management and your institution's learning and teaching centre.
