# Do the little things matter in design for learning? 

In learning what matters most is what the learner does. As people looking to help people learn we can't make them learn. The best we can do is to create learning situations - see Goodyear, Carvalho & Yeoman (2021) for why I'm using situation and not environment. We design the task, the learning space and social organisation (alone, pairs, groups etc.) that make up the situation in which they will engage in some activity. Hopefully activity that will lead to the learning outcomes we had in mind when designing the situation.

But maybe not. We can't be certain. All we can do is create a learning situation that is more likely to encourage them to engage in "good" activity.

How much do the little things matter in the design of these learning situations?

We spend an awful lot of time on the big picture things. A lot of time is spent on: creating, mapping and aligning learning outcomes; ensuring we've chosen the right task informed by the right learning theory and research to achieve those outcomes; and, a lot of time selecting, building, and supporting the physical and digital learning spaces in which the activity will take place. But what about the little things?

Are the little things important? I'm not sure, but in my experience the little things are not widely taken care of. Why? What impact does this have on learners and learning?

Some early thinking about these questions follow.
## What are some "little things"?

To paraphrase [Potter Stewart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it) I shan't attempt to define "little things" but rather show what I think I mean with some examples. 
### Using web links

In a web-based learning situation, it's not uncommon to require students to use some additional web-based resources to complete the task. For example, read some document, contribute to a discussion board etc. If the resource is online then it appears to make sense to use a core feature of the web and provide a link to that resource. It's a little thing to create a learning situation like A rather than B.

### Specific dates

I ask because they annoy me and I think they matter. I spend a bit of time figuring out how to sustainably fix these problems.  They appear to matter because they are mentioned elsehwere **e.g. see institutional advice about dates*** But also because they never seem to be solved lots of places use them

Questions for You

1. Do these types of "little things" matter

## Some "little things" don't appear to be common
## Some "little things" appear to matter somewhat

Talk about Colin's course and focus on the students identifying things that they liked...

## Why do they matter?

No evidence they postively improve learning outcomes and "the difficulty literature" suggests that there is some value in making things somewhat hard.

But the survey results suggest that they positevly impact the student experience and recollection

## Why haven't they been solved?

Reasons

- Reusability context - many of these are Specific e.g. dates
- Cross systems
- A lack of foward oriented design 

- Focus on curriculum design and learnng design projects
- Lack of focus on activities?
- Lack of focus on "what the teacher does"
