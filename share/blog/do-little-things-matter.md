# Do the little things matter in design for learning? 


In learning what matters most is what the learner does. We can't design what they do. All we can do is design learning environments for learning. Environments that are more likely than not to encourage/enable learning.

This is what design for learning aims to do. There's a lot of theory and research that goes into it. Important stuff. But what about the little things? Do they matter?

Little things like

- Direct links
> When a tasks asks the learner to post to a discussion forum, is there a link that takes them directly to that forum ready to post? Or do learners have to figure out where and which discussion forum to post in?
- Specific dates
    > When an assignment is due ... 

I ask because they annoy me and I think they matter. I spend a bit of time figuring out how to sustainably fix these problems.  They appear to matter because they are mentioned elsehwere **e.g. see institutional advice about dates*** But also because they never seem to be solved lots of places use them

Questions for You

1. Do these types of "little things" matter

## Evidence they might matter

Talk about Colin's course and focus on the students identifying things that they liked...

## Why do they matter?

No evidence they postively improve learning outcomes and "the difficulty literature" suggests that there is some value in making things somewhat hard.

But the survey results suggest that they positevly impact the student experience and recollection

## Why haven't they been solved?

Reasons

- Reusability context - many of these are Specific e.g. dates
- Cross systems
- A lack of foward oriented design 

- Focus on curriculum design and learnng design projects
- Lack of focus on activities?
- Lack of focus on "what the teacher does"
