It's widely accepted that the most important part of learning and teaching is **what the student does** @biggsWhatStudentDoes2012. The spaces, tools and tasks in which learning takes place are in some way designed by a teacher but are subsequently adapted by learners @goodyearDesignCoconfigurationHybrid2020. Designing learning spaces are not easy. Especially as those learning spaces increasingly make use of digital technologies. Especially when the [low digital fluency of teachers](https://djon.es/blog/2014/09/12/you-want-digitally-fluent-faculty/) is seen as a significant challenge @johnsonNMCHorizonReport2014. The deficit model of faculty has tended to hide significant shortcomings in the complex assemblage of agents required by institutional digital learning @jonesBreakingBADBridge2014.

*what about importance of being context specifioeadc to learning*

## Watching films - a discipline-specific activity

*Number of courses that need to watch films. A part of that is being able to access the film. on-campus that's perhaps not a problem. But what about courses that are totally online. Students never come to campus.* 

## Watching films - the current solution

The following is a generic description of what I imagine the situation is like at many institutions.

### The learner experience

** rewrite this from the learner perspective **

### The teacher experience 

1. The teacher designs the course and the films to be viewed.
2. Adds these into the course reading list.
3. Library staff do the hard work tracking down films and adding URLs (where possible)
4. The updated information is available in the reading list that is linked to from the course site

However, for various reasons the reading list is widely seen as somewhat difficult to use for students. Subequently, it's not unusual to see PDFs of readings being uploaded directly into a course site. It's also not unusual to see a reading list that is a little out of date with what is used in the course.

Online versions of films aren't always available.  **more here**

*more examples of films not being available* *Causing difficulties*

## *Film Watching Options* - a CASA solution

The following describes the Context-Appropriate Scaffolding Assemblage we've developed. It's called *Film Watching Options*

### Learner perspective

It's week 2 of term, the learner visits the week 1 online site and sees something like the following. 

**inert image of Content Interface with a couple of films - justwatch and embedded** 

From the week 1 material the learner can see that there are two films to watch this week. The first - *insert filmname* - is available to students as an embed ready to start playing. The second - *insert filename* - isn't available via the institution. For this film there's a link to a search on [the site JustWatch](https://justwatch.com). This link will perform a search of all the Australian online options for watching that film as shown in the following image.
