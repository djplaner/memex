It's widely accepted that the most important part of learning and teaching is **what the student does** @biggsWhatStudentDoes2012. The spaces, tools and tasks in and through which students "do stuff" (i.e. learning, or not) takes place are in some way designed by a teacher but are subsequently adapted by learners @goodyearDesignCoconfigurationHybrid2020. This post attempt to illustrate a limitation of how universities currently help support teachers design digital learning spaces, tools and tasks (from now on I'll use *learning activity* to capture all this). i.e. how current approaches fail to support the design, use and maintenance of contextually and discipline specific learning activities. The suggestion is that doing this may bring significant benefits. 

Designing learning spaces, tools and tasks is not easy. Especially when digital technologies are involved. Especially when the [low digital fluency of teachers](https://djon.es/blog/2014/09/12/you-want-digitally-fluent-faculty/) is seen as a (for some **the**) significant challenge @johnsonNMCHorizonReport2014. Hence the big focus on solutions such as requiring all teachers to have a formal teaching qualification. Formal "certification" programs such as the HEA. Or the focus on running workshops and producing online "how-to" support material. The focus on teacher knowledge, in many cases a deficit model of teacher knowledge, tends to ignore the distributed nature of the knowledge required. It doesn't just reside in the heads of the teachers but is distributed amongst the other agents (people, technologies, policies etc) in the institutional learning and teaching system @jonesTPACKSharedPractice2015a.  

When knowledge is distributed, it is also situated and highly contextual. As such, know the details of any learning and teaching model or theory is of limited practical value. **pick up on Goodyear's post about the value of models and point to Stommel's post about the limitations of models** But more than this the knowledge of models still has to be translated into the design of learning activities within a specific learning and teaching context. The model's suggestions needs to be adapted and customised to the specifics of the learning activity, including the specific discipline, the specific set of digital technology, the specific set of institutional policies, the specific student cohort etc. This is the real wicked design problem of design for learning. Where **Jesse's discussion about difficult problems** occurs.

This post will
1. Introduce a discipline specific learning activity.
2. Describe - in all its flaws - the learner and teacher experiences of engaging with current common implementations of that learning activity.
3. Illustrate some of the ways the learner and teacher experience is improved by the ability to better support discipline specific learning activities.
4. Explore some of the ways this might be done sustainably.

## Watching films - a discipline-specific activity

A key activity for courses such as film analysis, history, direction etc. is watching films. Analysing existing films to see how certain theories and design principles have been leveraged and their impact. A necessary first step in such a learning activity is being able to source and watch the film. In an on-campus learning experience this is probably a face-to-face experience in a scheduled class. In a totally online learning experience this is commonly done via the course web site. Either way the teacher/institution typically organises access to the film and designs some activity around it.

This type of close analysis of a film typically only a part of a handful (or two) of courses at a university. If there's any institutional support for this activity it is typically a small part of a broader process. e.g. legally (copyright) correct sourcing of films may be part of the library service. But typically, designing this learning activity draws more on the significant capabilities and expertise of the teacher. Not unlike most of the other activities specific to the other disciplines. Typically this appears to work in the face-to-face environment, but what happens when it goes online?

## Watching films in an online course - the current solution

The following is a generic description summarising the practice I've observed at a couple of different institutions. I imagine it's fairly typical. I'm sure there are much better examples of current practice. But my hypothesis is that those better examples were dependent upon an individual with a unique combination of knowledge and skills.

### The learner experience

Somewhere on the course site the learner will discover that they need to watch a film (or two) this week. This may be via an announcement, a list of films in a course profile or course reading list, or some details in this week's page on the course site. There will some details about the film (e.g. director, year of production etc.), perhaps a description of how to engage with the film, and there might be access to a digital version of the film.

Since many films are commercial, copyrighted artefacts. Providing digital access to the film is not straight forward. In some cases the institution may be able to provide access. In other cases the learners or teachers may have shared URLs enabling (probably legally dubious and short-lived) access. In other cases the student is left up to their own devices to gain access to the film. With the rise of streaming services this is significantly easier. However, the nature and diversity of the films used in such courses is such that no single streaming service will provide access. Increasing expense for learners. Also, not all such films will be available via streaming services.

Consequently, learners typically expend a fair bit of cognitive effort and time gaining access to films. A cognitive effort expense which may be seen as a part of the necessary and relevant learning for the course. But it may be a cognitive enegy expense that limits what the learner invests in the actual important learning activities involved in understanding and analysing the film. I have heard reports of learners in such courses being frustrated at having to expend this cognitive effort.

### The teacher experience

The teacher of such a course faces four broad questions. Answering these questions is not sequential. My answer to question #1 may change depending on the answer to question #2. The four questions are: 
1. Which films should the students engage with?
2. Can I provide access to those films?
3. How to point students to those films and what they need to do?
4. How well did those films/activities work and what do I need to change for next time?

Answering question #1 draws on the discipline knowledge of the teacher. All the other questions require knowledge that is not (solely) discipline knowledge.

Answering question #2 involves knowledge of copyright law and various institutional systems and processes.  that the university's library. Most provide a service that can legally gain digital access to films. Well, most films. Such a process is typically part of a broader process of providing resources for teaching (e.g. [my current institution](https://www.griffith.edu.au/library/teaching/resources)) which may feed into some sort of formal course reading list. I've yet to see such a formal course reading list that is useful for learning and teaching.

Answering question #3 requires pedagogical and technical knowledge to figure where, when and how to embed this information in a course site. It's the teacher that needs this knowledge. They are provided with generic tools (announcements, discussion boards, and content editing), maybe the formal course reading list, and supported by generic technical and pedagogical advice about how to use the provided tools. None of this is specific to film watching.

Hence answers to question #3 are largely variable. See mention of learner frustration in the previous section. The most common solution I've seen is just a description of the films to watch such as the following simple example.

![Simple example of a list of films to watch](images/simpleFilmList.png)

Answering question #4 requires knowledge of learner activity, learner outcomes, learner satisfaction with the experience of using the film watching activities. It also requires the knowledge and skills necessary to analyse, reflect, and re-design. All of this knowledge is rarely available in any way that could be considered systematic or deep. And a simple list like the above example doesn't help.

## *Film Watching Options* - a CASA solution

The following describes the Context-Appropriate Scaffolding Assemblage we've developed. It's called *Film Watching Options*

### Learner perspective

It's week 2 of term, the learner visits the week 1 online site and sees something like the following. 

**inert image of Content Interface with a couple of films - justwatch and embedded** 

From the week 1 material the learner can see that there are two films to watch this week. The first - *insert filmname* - is available to students as an embed ready to start playing. The second - *insert filename* - isn't available via the institution. For this film there's a link to a search on [the site JustWatch](https://justwatch.com). This link will perform a search of all the Australian online options for watching that film as shown in the following image.
