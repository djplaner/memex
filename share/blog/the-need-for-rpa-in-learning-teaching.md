# Introduction

- RPA is billon dollar industry growing since ??
- Universities have started projects to leverage RPA in administrative work, but anecdotally not as obviously in learning and teaching 
- RPA is one example of a broader recognition that enterprise information systems practices are not sufficient, but it's not yet in L&T
- at least not in formal organisational structure and projects (individual staff having been engaged in activities like RPA forever)
- Aim here is to illustrate that the need for RPA for administrative purposes is even more prevalent in L&T in tertiary education - with its focus on lots of disparate digital technology to support large numbers of students and the on-going struggle to unite those technologies into an efficient and effective L&T environment

"Digital transformation" increasingly features in the strategic plans for many universities. Personally observed plans for achieving "digital transformation" currently appear to largely focused on the IT department implementing lots of big enterprise platforms. As highlighted above those platforms are probably going to struggle to meet the purposes of the learners, teachers, and other staff trying to implement "digital transformation".

Anne-Marie Scott writes about a [very different take on digital transformation](https://ammienoot.com/brain-fluff/digital-transformation-and-why-it-cant-be-done-without-learning-technologists/). One where digital transformation won't work if all the digital expertise is constrained in the IT department.
