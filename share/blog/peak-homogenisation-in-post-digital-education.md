# Peak consistency in Digital Education 

Consistency is the new black for digital education. Some have even argued that it is "key in online learning" (Scutelnicu, Tekula, Gordon, Knepper, 2019). That it is the #1 thing that students want ([Sankey, 2018](https://www.slideshare.net/michaelsankey/online-learning-transformation)). I'm not a fan. While proponents claim that consistency is not sameness, my fear is that a focus on consistency leads to homogenisation. I'm concerned we're heading for peak consistency.

To explore this the following touches on some history of consistency, some of the practices driving increases in consistency, indicators of trouble, and an alternative.

## Second generation distance education: When consistency was king

My start in higher education was at a dual-mode university in the early 1990s. We taught courses on-campus and via second generation distance education. Second generation distance education involved an industralised approach to the design and production of a packages of study materials that were mailed out to students who never set foot on a campus and rarely talked directly to another student or a teacher. Teachers designed the study materials, often with the help of a team. There was a central division responsible for producing and distributing the study material and ensuring consistency and improving quality. [Dekkers and Kemp (1995)](https://books.google.com.au/books?hl=en&lr=&id=OfWfHcUmbnYC&oi=fnd&pg=PA311&dq=kemp+dekkers+distance+education&ots=gB94qN_8jG&sig=qpY9IQ2H4fwrongl-xpc6jWPLSs&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=kemp%20dekkers%20distance%20education&f=false) describe the thinking that went into the production of this study material.

This is good ...but maybe link to prolog story.

## Online learning to the rescue

Come the 2000s and online learning technology offered the ability to dismantle all that was no longer needed. The LMS provided a platform by which teaching staff would be able to create learning environments with minimal help. More like the face-to-face environment than print-based distance education. And, just like the face-to-face environment, the online environment saw a huge diversity in the quality and type of learner experiences. It just didn't work that well.

Back in the day, support for this diversity was promoted as one of the benefits of those systems. i.e. you weren't constrained to a particular pedagogy or approach. You could assemble the affordances of the system(s) to achieve your specific learning and teaching goals. There were instances of this. Good things could be done with those systems. But these were the exception. The norm was less good and more diverse.

## The return of homogenisation - learning design

__hark back to the reference_  consistency returned. More design.

Perhaps MOOCs played a part. For a time, offering a course as a [xMOOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course#cMOOCs_and_xMOOCs) was a "strategic priority" (aka [FOMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out)). This meant resourcing that enabled design teams working together to fit a particular xMOOC model. A model often built into the platform the MOOC was offered on. MOOC platforms tended to be more explicit about their focus on a particular set of affordances. For example, at a more technical level, the [Future Learn design system](https://design-system.futurelearn.com/). At the same time there's been increased adoption of activity-based learning design approaches such as [ABC Learning Design](https://abc-ld.org/). More recently, there's been [talk about the value](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBU76mlA0_w&feature=youtu.be) gained from combining activity-based learning design and design systems. Approaches that provide a consistent language and focus for effort to address the difficulty of designing digital education. 

## The return of homogenisation - sterile technologies and aping social media

The web-based LMS of the 90s/00s were generative technologies, as defined by Zittrain (2008). Technologies that could - almost entirely due to their use of generative web technologies (e.g. Javascript, CSS etc) - be modified by a broad array of people in response to specific needs. It required some knowledge of those technologies but it was fairly widely spread and was done (e.g. Abhrahamson & Hillman, 2016; [Jones, 2019](https://djon.es/blog/2019/08/08/exploring-knowledge-reuse-in-design-for-digital-learning-tweaks-h5p-constructive-templates-and-casa/); Plaisted & Tkachov, 2011). As Zittrain (2008) points out generativity can be a plus and a minus. For every effective customisation of an LMS, there's some horrendous combination of Comic Sans, poor colour choices, blinking text, poor contrast backgrounds, paragaphs of bolded text, and some Javascript/CSS that breaks something.

The new generation of digital education systems are increasingly more sterile. Blackboard Ultra explicitly prevents the use of web technologies like HTML, CSS and Javascript. To ensure that you can't negatively impact the mobile-first, responsive, simpler, and stream-based activity design of Ultra. Similarly, it [removes the choice teachers](https://www.jasonrhode.com/my-initial-thoughts-on-blackboards-ultra-new-learning-experience-lms) may have had around how to structure their choice. Apparently aiming for more a Facebook/social media interface than an open web interface.

At the same time, the rise in Australian Higher Education of Microsoft Teams reinforces this move from the web to social media. The move to becoming like social media

But increasingly consistnecy is baked into the technology

## The return of homogenisation - cost and strategy

Point to the systems blog post.  The increasing centralisation linking to homogenisation

Mention about course profile systems, standards, etc other organisational issues

## The return of homogenisation - A paucity of software develop(ers|ment)

Move to cloud systems meant we don't employ software developers. We employ people that explain how to use cloud services and maybe people to stich them together at the back end.

People solving specific institutional tasks by writing software are disappearing.

## Peak homogenisation?

The homogenisation above is driven by 

- aping a successful social media
- aping organisational practices (e.g. strategy etc)

Giving into fast thinking, rather than engaging with slow.

Because it requires effort. I worry that we wont stop climing the peak of homogenisation until we reach the top.

I wonder what the tumble down the other side will look like?

## Is there an alternative?
