# Digital learning activities and issues with the conservation of complexity

Good learning and teaching is about what the student does. Hence the focus on learning activities. 
My hypotheses is that implementing digital learning activities effective and efficiently is too complex. Our inability to handle the inherent complexity is a major contributing factor to the perceived poor quality of learning and teaching

## What we want the student to do

Explain film watching for a particular type of course. Outline the entire steps that a student has to does.How elements in the environment make it easier or better to does.

But what we want them to do is actually engage in depth with the film. ANalyse it in someway. Share their thoughts. Develop their thoughts etc.

## Inherent complexity of that task

Talk about this - link to the natur eof the task this is where the finding and watching come into it

## Conservation of complexity

Explain the law.  If we want to make this easier, someone has to do the work.

## Reading list approach

- describe that

*Explain conservation of complexity*
