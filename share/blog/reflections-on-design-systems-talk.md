# Reflections on Design Systems Talk


Joyce gave a talk last week.  It's important. Go watch it.

This post is my reflection on that presentation. In short, it's important. If you're at an institution not thinking about this type of approach then you're missing out.  

I'm not sure I agree with everything Joyce describes, but that's not because of any problems with what her and her colleagues have done at RMIT online.  It has more to do with
1. That the affordances of a less than 60 minute presentation don't allow me to fully grasp the detail and intracies of what's been done.
2. I'm coming at it from a different place.

It's important because it grapples directly with what I see as the biggest challenge facing higher education. How to improve the quality of learning and teaching.  **talk about my framing of this as imporving the knowledge of how to do it**

A challenge that was hard enough at the end of 2019 (**ref to ascilite**) but has become both more difficult and more important as the 2020 experience suggests that there will be signifiant

It's important because it's one example of systematic change. It's not an attempt to use a new technology, adopt a new marketing term,...etc...
