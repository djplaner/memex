# Reflections on Design Systems Talk


On October 30 I watched a [webinar](https://twitter.com/COL4D/status/1321838452271271936) given by Joyce Seitzinger ([@catspyjamasnz](https://twitter.com/catspyjamasnz)) and hosted by the [Commonwealth of Learning](https://www.col.org/) - "How Learning Design Systems can help scale and accelerate learning design". If you work in higher education helping with the practice of digital or [post-digital education](https://www.springer.com/journal/42438) - which is a bigger group of folk than it was 12 months ago - then I highly recommend the talk and the approach. (Though it appears that the CoL has yet made available a recording of the webinar.)

I consider this important work because it engages with one of the more challenging and important questions facing higher education
> How might the diverse knowledge required for effective design for digital learning be shared and used sustainably and at scale?

The literature ([Jones, 2019](https://djon.es/blog/2019/08/08/exploring-knowledge-reuse-in-design-for-digital-learning-tweaks-h5p-constructive-templates-and-casa/)) recognises this question as essential to higher education, but also identifies significant problems with existing solutions. Buying new technology, running PD sessions outlining the 5 guidelines for X aren't cutting it, or doing ad hoc design projects aren't cutting it. The work Joyce and her colleagues are doing with Learning Design Systems draws on successful practices from a different realm in an attempt to systematically answer the question.

I'm not sure what was described offers a complete solution. But that's probably more to do with my limitations and the limitations of a 60 minute webinar on a complex topic, than on inherent limitations in the approach. The following is my attempt to reflect on the webinar and identifying the outstanding questiions I'm thinking about.

## A summary

First, my summary of what was discussed with some broader connections made.

### A familiar problem

Joyce's presentation started out talking about an increasingly familiar problem facing higher education, especially within Australia. i.e. the increasing complexity of the inputs and expected outputs of learning design. At RMIT Online this involves a need to design large numbers of diverse courses that are offered multiple times a year to an increasing number of students. Where the design and delivery of those courses involves an increasingly diverse modes and is supported by a diversity of partners. With subject matter experts including both traditional academics and external experts, and increasingly involving other partners. Increasingly, these courses are leading to different credentials.

These are trends I'm seeing across Australian higher education. One of the more recent has been the [rise of micro-credentials](https://odlaa.org/past-webinars/) partially in response to [moves by the Australian Federal Government](https://www.zdnet.com/article/australian-government-to-build-au4-3-million-online-microcredentials-marketplace/). Moves that mean Australian Universities are increasingly going to face the same problem that Joyce describes.

### Design Systems - a less familiar solution

Joyce pointed out that seeing teaching as _design for learning_ has long been recommended as one solution to the increasing difficulty and requirement for quality learning and teaching (e.g. Goodyear, 2015). What Joyce didn't mention directly is that in higher education the practice of teaching as _design for learning_ isn't as widespread as it should be. In part, because effective _design for learning_ requires a detailed and diverse collection of knowledge. Knowledge that not many teachers have and which institutions continue to struggle with providing at scale.

Joyce's solution to this scaling problem is [design systems](http://www.designbetter.co/design-systems-handbook). An idea drawn directly from web design. In web design, design systems specify in detail the common components that are used to design a web sites and applications (Churchill, 2019). Joyce points to design systems examples such as [Atlassian](https://atlassian.design/) and one more focused on digital learning from [Future Learn](https://design-system.futurelearn.com/). Churchill (2019) points to [this gallery of different (web) design systems](https://designsystemsrepo.com/design-systems/). 

The fundamental idea behind design systems is not new. Manufacturing, industrial design, and architecture (e.g. Alexander et al, 1977) have been using collection of modular components to share the knowledge required to construct large scale products for quite a while. Suarez et al ([n.d](https://www.designbetter.co/design-systems-handbook)) cite McIlroy's (1968) proposal for software components as a solution to the (first?) software crisis as inspiration for design systems. [Tesler's Law of the Conservation of Complexity](https://humanist.co/blog/law-of-conservation-of-complexity/) arises from addressing a similar problem 20 years later in dealing with the production of GUI software. The hypermedia community was talking about patterns and constructive templates in the late 1990s (Nanard, Nanard & Khan, 1998). Echoing work in object oriented programming (Gamma et al, 1995) that had significant impact on practice, and later work with design patterns for educational design and network learning (Jones, 1999; Goodyear, 2005) - that had less impact on practice.

### Learning Design Systems

Design systems for the web don't having anything to say about design for learning. Raising the question about what makes for a learnign design system?  Joyce's answer appears to answer this by adding fairly common contemporary practices in higher education, including: adopting a collection of learning design principles and standards; and, a focus on a collection of activity types.

The seven learning design principles include a focus on designing specifically for online (assessment, learning activities, resources, tools and social interactions) and explicit integration of industry relevant. These provide a shared goal for design and enable quality assurance.

Course design focuses on learning activities as the "pedagogical building blocks". A small taxonomy of activity types is specified (assimilative, experiential, interactive, productive, social, meta cognitive) echoing taxonomies from [Diana Laurillard](https://ki.instructure.com/courses/115/pages/diana-laurilliards-six-learning-types) (acquisition, inquiry, collaboration, discussion, practice, production) and the Open University ([Toetenel & Rientes, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1080/02680513.2016.1213626)) (assimilative, finding/handling information, communication, productive, experiential, interactive/adaptive, assessment). Linked in turn with a focus on constructive alignment.

Wrapped around this is a collection of artefacts including: guidlines, templates, process, examples, and training. For each course, these artefacts are used by a design team including: course coordinator; designing academic; learnign designer; and, multimedia developers.

### Effectiveness?

Measures provides to illustrate the positive impact of this approach, included
- Reduction in course development time (28 to 16 weeks)
- More reliable quality at QA checkpoints
- Internal team spending less time on course projects
- Improved pass rates and student satisfaction

## Questions?

And now onto the questions I have.

### Is it just a better conceptualised version of common practice?

I've seen examples

### Where are the components?



### What about the reusability paradox?

### What about when design for learning doesn't/can't occur?

More courses and teaching than designers. 

Design system can help speed up the process of design.

Goodyear quote about short-term design and comment that others don't design

Provision of components that others can use
