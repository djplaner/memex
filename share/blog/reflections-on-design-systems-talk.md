# Reflections on Design Systems Talk


On October 30 I watched a [webinar](https://twitter.com/COL4D/status/1321838452271271936) (recording below) given by Joyce Seitzinger ([@catspyjamasnz](https://twitter.com/catspyjamasnz)) and hosted by the [Commonwealth of Learning](https://www.col.org/). It was titled, "How Learning Design Systems can help scale and accelerate learning design". If you work in higher education helping with the practice of digital (or [post-digital education](https://www.springer.com/journal/42438)) - which is a bigger group of folk than it was 12 months ago - then I highly recommend the talk and the approach. 

I consider this important work because it engages with one of the more challenging and important questions facing higher education
> How might the diverse knowledge required for effective design for digital learning be shared and used sustainably and at scale?
Or to put it more concretely how do Universities [move beyond providing guidance and actually help](https://lawriephipps.co.uk/reflections-week-twelve-people-wanted-help-we-gave-them-guidance/) with the provision of digital education.

The literature (e.g. the intro of [Jones, 2019](https://djon.es/blog/2019/08/08/exploring-knowledge-reuse-in-design-for-digital-learning-tweaks-h5p-constructive-templates-and-casa/)) recognises this question as essential to higher education, but also identifies significant problems with existing solutions. Buying new technology, running PD sessions outlining the "5 guidelines for X", or doing ad hoc instructional design projects aren't cutting it. The work Joyce and her colleagues are doing with Learning Design Systems draws on successful practices from a different realm in an attempt to systematically answer the question.

However, after listening to and reflecting on Joyce's talk I have some questions. I'm wondering if there are missing bits. Perhaps these bits are missing due to my limitations and the limitations of a (less than) 60 minute webinar on a complex topic. The following is my attempt to reflect on the webinar and identify the questiions I have about Joyce's approach and what it means for what I do. Feel free to let me know what I'm missing.

## A summary

First, my summary of the talk. With some connections to related resources.

### A familiar problem

Joyce's presentation started out talking about an increasingly familiar problem facing higher education, especially within Australia. i.e. the increasing complexity of the inputs and expected outputs of learning design. At RMIT Online this involves a need to design large numbers of diverse courses that are offered multiple times a year to an increasing number of students. Where the design and delivery of those courses involves an increasingly diverse modes and is supported by a diversity of partners. With subject matter experts including both traditional academics and external experts, and increasingly involving other partners. Increasingly, these courses are leading to different credentials.

These are trends I'm seeing across Australian higher education. One of the more recent has been the [rise of micro-credentials](https://odlaa.org/past-webinars/) partially in response to [moves by the Australian Federal Government](https://www.zdnet.com/article/australian-government-to-build-au4-3-million-online-microcredentials-marketplace/). Moves that mean Australian Universities are increasingly going to face the same problem that Joyce describes.

### Design Systems - a less familiar solution

Joyce pointed out that seeing teaching as _design for learning_ has long been recommended as one solution to the increasing difficulty and requirement for quality learning and teaching (e.g. Goodyear, 2015). What Joyce didn't mention directly is that in higher education the practice of teaching as _design for learning_ isn't as widespread as it should be. In part, because effective _design for learning_ requires a detailed and diverse collection of knowledge. Knowledge that not many teachers have and which institutions continue to struggle with providing at scale.

Joyce's solution to this scaling problem is [design systems](http://www.designbetter.co/design-systems-handbook). An idea drawn directly from web design. In web design, design systems specify in detail the common components that are used to design a web sites and applications (Churchill, 2019). Joyce points to design systems examples such as [Atlassian](https://atlassian.design/) and one more focused on digital learning from [Future Learn](https://design-system.futurelearn.com/). Churchill (2019) points to [this gallery of different (web) design systems](https://designsystemsrepo.com/design-systems/). 

The fundamental idea behind design systems is not new. Manufacturing, industrial design, and architecture (e.g. Alexander et al, 1977) have been using collection of modular components to share the knowledge required to construct large scale products for quite a while. Suarez et al ([n.d](https://www.designbetter.co/design-systems-handbook)) cite McIlroy's (1968) proposal for software components as a solution to the (first?) software crisis as inspiration for design systems. [Tesler's Law of the Conservation of Complexity](https://humanist.co/blog/law-of-conservation-of-complexity/) arises from addressing a similar problem 20 years later in dealing with the production of GUI software. The hypermedia community was talking about patterns and constructive templates in the late 1990s (Nanard, Nanard & Khan, 1998). Echoing work in object oriented programming (Gamma et al, 1995) that had significant impact on practice, and later work with design patterns for educational design and network learning (Jones, 1999; Goodyear, 2005) - that had less impact on practice.

#### What is a design system?

I was looking for a definition of a design system to use in this post. A task more difficult than I thought it should be. The first definition that started to resonate [I found here](https://uxdesign.cc/everything-you-need-to-know-about-design-systems-54b109851969)
> A Design System is the single source of truth which groups all the elements that will allow the teams to design, realize and develop a product.

A source that has a nice image outlining some common elements of a design system, including: identity spec; principles; best practices; components & patterns; tools; style guide and pattern library etc.

### Learning Design Systems

Design systems for the web don't having anything to say about design for learning. Raising the question about what makes for a learnign design system?  Joyce's answer appears to answer this by adding fairly common contemporary practices in higher education, including: adopting a collection of learning design principles and standards; and, a focus on a collection of activity types.

The seven learning design principles include a focus on designing specifically for online (assessment, learning activities, resources, tools and social interactions) and explicit integration of industry relevant. These provide a shared goal for design and enable quality assurance.

Course design focuses on learning activities as the "pedagogical building blocks". A small taxonomy of activity types is specified (assimilative, experiential, interactive, productive, social, meta cognitive) echoing taxonomies from [Diana Laurillard](https://ki.instructure.com/courses/115/pages/diana-laurilliards-six-learning-types) (acquisition, inquiry, collaboration, discussion, practice, production) and the Open University ([Toetenel & Rientes, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1080/02680513.2016.1213626)) (assimilative, finding/handling information, communication, productive, experiential, interactive/adaptive, assessment). Linked in turn with a focus on constructive alignment.

Wrapped around this is a collection of artefacts including: guidlines, templates, process, examples, and training. For each course, these artefacts are used by a design team including: course coordinator; designing academic; learnign designer; and, multimedia developers.

### Effectiveness?

Measures provides to illustrate the positive impact of this approach, included
- Reduction in course development time (28 to 16 weeks)
- More reliable quality at QA checkpoints
- Internal team spending less time on course projects
- Improved pass rates and student satisfaction

## Questions?

And now onto the questions I have.

### Is it just a better conceptualised version of common practice?

Much of what was discussed in the talk - a focus on activity types, constructive alignment, course recipe type abstractions, course development teams, course standards or principles - I have seen in use elsewhere. For example, [ABC Learning Design](https://abc-ld.org/) and the practices adopted by groups similar to RMIT Online (where Joyce works). Though in my experience those examples were perhaps as not complete and as consistently implemented as Joyce described.

Beyond good implementation, I'm wondering what makes this work an example of a "design system" rather than an instructional design process/team?

Which brings me to the next question.

### Where are the components? The learning activity components?

In introducting design systems for the web, [Suarez et al (n.d)](https://www.designbetter.co/design-systems-handbook/introducing-design-systems) argue that design systems rely on the combination of 2 concepts: standards; and, **components**. Where they define components as
> portions of reusable code within your system and they serve as the building blocks of your applicationâ€™s interface.

The Future Learn design system - fairly typically for a web design systems and cite by Joyce - provides a [collection of components](https://design-system.futurelearn.com/molecules). As Suarez et al (n.d) the benefit components provide is that they reduce "technical overhead". They do this by packaging necessary design knowledge into a reusable package. The presence of a wide collection of components that can be creatively mixed to build new designs is what makes it easier to scale design. 

I didn't recognise any mention of components in Joyce's talk. The closest perhaps being the activity types. But I didn't see anything like the Future Learn catalogue of components.

Even the Future Learn catalogue is also somewhat limited. All of the components appear to be fairly typical web interface (content) components. For example, [card](https://design-system.futurelearn.com/molecules/card), [feedback message](https://design-system.futurelearn.com/molecules/feedback-message), and [timeline](https://design-system.futurelearn.com/molecules/timeline)). None of which I'd consider learning activities. Hence the Future Learn system appears likely to help with scaling the design of the web pages/sites, but not so much help with scaling learning design.

The Future Learn systems is based on the Atomic Design Methodology for web design systems.  Atomic Design has [five (non-linear) stages of design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/)
1. Atoms 
   > Basic HTML elements that can be broken down any further. Fairly abstract.
2. Molecules
   > Simple groups of atoms (e.g. search form) that have a specific purpose.
3. Organisms
   > Complex collections of atoms, molecules and other organisms (e.g. a header that includes a search form). Apparently, organisms provide "an important sense of context" and used to form specific sections of an interface.
4. Templates
   > A collection of components placed into a layout to specify a content structure. i.e. there is a focus on structure, rather than content.
5. Pages
   > Specific instances of templates.

Folk at Future Learn [describe the confusion](https://www.futurelearn.com/info/blog/atomic-design-molecules-organisms) they had drawing the line between molecules and organisms. Hence they dropped organisms.

Where would learning activity components fit in the Atomic Design Methodology? Would defining organisms as molecules that enable a specific learning activity/task be a place to add in an explicit learning and teaching focus?  Or is that just too low a level for an activity that might involve numerous people, completing quite complex tasks, extended over a lengthy time period? 

Somewhere in here is also where [the PSU web component work](https://webcomponents.psu.edu/styleguide/?path=/story/about-getting-started--using-penn-state-cdn) enters the picture. This is a collection of web components which you can use now thanks to [their unbundled approach](https://dev.to/btopro/part-1-how-penn-state-unbundles-web-components-for-cdn-deployments-20di). An approach which I think is potentially very useful for a design system.  Though, at the moment, their components are also more focused on content than learning activities.

### What about a forward-oriented design perspective?

Dimitriadis and Goodyear ([2013](https://journal.alt.ac.uk/index.php/rlt/article/view/1402)) argue that design for learning (aka learning design) needs to be more forward-oriented.  That is, there's a need to move away from the view of design as producing a course (learning task/environment etc) so it's ready for the start of semester. To move away from the idea that design is somehow separate from the other stages in the lifecycle of a course. Instead, when designing, there's a need to actively consider what will be required during configuration, orchestration, evaluation, and reflection and respond to that. 

Extending that to components, a learning activity component should not only embody design knowledge that helps with creating an effective, consistent interface. It needs to offer functionality that embodies design knowledge that helps learners and teachers during learntime (orchestration) etc. As a simple example, a component that [displays options for watching films](https://djon.es/blog/2020/08/15/supporting-the-design-of-discipline-specific-digital-learning-activities/) within learning material in a consistent, effective way (see image below) depending on how the institution has been able to provide access. A component that recognises the film availability changes and hence the learning materials need to be kept up to date. A process that can be painful if the film is mentioned multiple times. A component that supports configuration by drawing film availability from a spreadsheet. Allowing the teacher to change a single line and have that automatically applied throughout the learning materials.

### What about when learning design doesn't/can't occur?

The RMIT online design system involves a team of five people with different skills helping with the design of each course. The literature has identified that this is a resource intensive approach and that such resources are not always possible. Joyce explains how their design system has reduced the required resources, enabling more scale. However, there is a limit to that. It's not possible (yet, perhaps) in all contexts. It's certainly not possible in the context in which I currently work. Nor has it been possible in any university in which I've worked over the last 30 years. Even where it was nominally possible - early 90s distance education - what passed for a team was very limited by a standardised "design system".

Consequently, a lot of the development of digital education is the responsibility of teachers. No designer in sight. Goodyear ([2009](https://ltr.edu.au/resources/Goodyear%2C%20P%20ALTC%20Fellowship%20report%202010.pdf)) introduces two images of teachers: long arc; and, short arc. The long arc teacher takes time to think about designing a course and associated tasks. A short arc teacher doesn't have that time. Arguably, the prevalence of short arc teachers is increasing. Goodyear's (2009) suggestion to help short arc teachers - who won't make use of traditional support measures - is to "embed good ideas __in__ these tools" (p. 16). i.e. the tools the short arc teacher uses day to day.

The short arc teacher resonates with the idea of a bricoleur. Someone when faced with a project does not engage in strategic analysis and design, but rather figures out how to achieve the project with the tools already at hand. A concept that has been previously applied to teachers (Hatton, 1989). A conception that suggests that if what teachers are currently doing with digital education is less than stellar, then the issue may be to do with the tools that they have at hand.

I'm wondering if an effective learning activity design system that is available to teachers might help improve the quality of digital education/

** insert card interface???**


Design system can help speed up the process of design.

This is also where bricolage comes into it

Goodyear quote about short-term design and comment that others don't design

Provision of components that others can use

### If and how do existing learning tools fit? Web and app-based?

If and how can the functionality provided by Learning Management Systems and stand-alone systems (e.g. PebblePad, Echo360) fit into a design system? 

Such systems generally don't play all that well together and when they do play together are limited to [LTI lego block integration](https://djon.es/blog/2020/01/30/three-mashup-types-for-digital-learning-and-teaching/#lti-the-problematic-lego-approach-metaphor-of-integration). There isn't a lot of ability to customise the look and feel to meet a particular design system.

One answer would be that not everything should be part of the learning design system. Learner experiences should move beyond the defined learning environment into different personal and public spaces beyond learning. A model that suggests that the learning design system provides the organising back bone of the learner experience. Drawing in external tools and data where appropriate and pointing learners out into the broader world.



Mention components as somethign that actually helps do something - Perhaps Ellis quote

Is this presence of components that helps move beyond?

### What might be some useful ways forward?


One suggestion - linked to the Atom Design Methodology - is [collaboratively naming existing practices](https://alistapart.com/article/language-of-modular-design/) to develop a pattern language (Alexander cropping up again) of components. This idea starts with what is done at the moment, but aims to build a language that can be reused. One reservation I have is context. This process is suggested in the context of a web design house. A very different context than what generally passes for digital learning design in contempoary higher education. i.e. a mish mash of document files and ill-used discussion forums created because the affordances of the existing tools don't lend itself to effective design.

This could lead into creation of Web components
