# Mapping courses with ABC LD

Is it possible to map an existing course and its activities using ABC LD?

i.e. could an existing course be abstracted to a collection of and sequence of certain activities. Activities abstracted enough to allow analysis and translation?

## [Excel](https://www.inclusiveweb.net/abc-learning-design/abc-ld-online-in-excel/)

Provides an [Excel spreadsheet](https://www.inclusiveweb.net/online-abc-ld-v3/) with the following sheets
- 0 Learning type activities - define the types and examples - used in drop downs
- i Definitions - defines the learning types
- Licence and version - as on the label 
- i Instructions - 
- 8 Actions - a to do list
- 1 & 7 Tweet and ILOs - about the course and learning outcomes
- 2 & 6 Shape - overview of the course and activities
- 8 Blend - showing how much online and f-t-f - not sure it's useful
- 4-op1 Storyboard - list of activity titles and types - uses drop downs from _0 Learning type activities_
- 4-op2 Learning Designer Export

### Possible process/

1. Work through course and its activities
    Remembering that activities can draw on multiple activity types
2. Categorise activities against learning types and create a new example(s)
3. Use categories on StoryBoard to keep track.
