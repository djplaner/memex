[Seek > Sense > Share](https://jarche.com/pkm/) is a personal knowledge management (PKM) framework developed by Harold Jarche. 

Positioned as a way for individuals to learn and work in an interconnected, digital world. A world that is moving away from routine work to a focus more on complexity and creativity. A move away from a focus on reducing errors to increasing insights.  Which requires more than individuals. Instead requiring diverse perspectives that challenge assumptions and create learning opportunities at the edge of our existing knowledge.

| Stage | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Seek | Develop & refine subject matter networks of expertise to filter signal from noise. Both machine and human. |
| Sense | Make sense by doing (experiment, initiate) & creating (customise, synthesise, question etc) |
| Share | Discern when, where & how to share in a spirit of openness & transparency. |
