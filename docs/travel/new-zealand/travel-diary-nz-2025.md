Quick notes of travel in New Zealand in July 2025.

## Friday 4th July, Toowoomba to Otorohanga

Up early to drive into Brisbane for a solo Jetstar flight to Auckland. Surprisingly quick drive-in. Some issues actually checking in. My new passport and a plethora of David Jones led to some official uncertainty about my fitness to travel. After one of the "senior" check-in staff had a long call with some import customer service line I was passed fit to leave the country.

Tailwinds meant the flight arrived early into Auckland. However, we were delayed leaving the plane due to a medical emergency. A good twenty minutes before we were off the plane. Quick and easy through passport, luggage collection, and customs. With only a slight delay in duty free.

Met outside the gate by my sister for the drive to Otorohanga. A much longer drive due to the it being Friday around 5pm heading out of Auckland. Only required to prompt Jenny to brake before running up the rear end of someone. Curried, home-made sausages waiting for dinner. Followed by some chatting and bed.

Stomach was somewhat unsettled as I went to bed delaying and reducing the quality of sleep. Aided temporarily by a late night visit to the toilet. Signs that some sort of food poisoning or flu.

## Saturday 5th July, Otorohanga

After a fairly wet night and a reasonable sleep it was time to get the lay of the land. Jenny and Barry introducing the house, animals, gardens, and paddocks. Pointing out all the various tasks to be completed. 

Barry's mother's 80th birthday celebrations planned in the Hamilton area. Jenny and Barry had a bit to prepare before the headed off around 1pm. I did try some of Barry's mini-sausage rolls for "lunch". Stomach still upset. It remained rainy after they left so I retired to bed.

Around 4 I was feeling somewhat better and the sun had come out. Time for a drive into Otorohanga. Visit the local Woolies and take short walk around the "Giant Pukeko". A local park with a lake and a statue of a giant Pukeko. A local bird.

The morning dawned clear and sunny. Sufficient for a quick walk out the front to check out the beasties. Main task for the day was dropping Barry, Jenny and Jonathon off at Auckland airport for the flights to Oz. ~2 hours there and back. Stomach still not great but some drugs used to help. Trip largely without incident, some delays on the way back due to an accident.

After almost 5 hours in the car and still feeling crook the rest of the day was spent reading [_Character Limit_](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/sep/18/character-limit-by-kate-conger-and-ryan-mac-review-musks-twitter-takeover) and trawling social media and the news. It was during the latter that I learned of the passing of Steve Munster. A good guy and great cricketer (esp. indoor) who I used to play cricket within the 90s. Commiserations to his family.

The rest of the evening to be spent figuring out what I can do tomorrow to get out and about a bit more.

## Monday 7th July, An easy day

Another fine day, actually caught a bit of the sunrise.

Still not quite recovered. A quiet day spent reading. Some walking around the farm before a longer walk around Otorohanga in the afternoon before a kebab for dinner. The first "real" food for a couple of days.

Major issue was the newly "repaired" boots turning out not to be repaired. 

## Tuesday 8th July, 

The boot issue meant any decent length walking was off the agenda. Headed to the [Ruakuri Bushwalk](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/waikato/places/waitomo-area/tracks/ruakuri-walk/) which is only 20 minutes down the road. Great walk, but the dampness reinforced the need for decent boots.

A lightly graveled track with a fair bit of dampish mud led up and down hills and through bush. Much cooler than outside the bush.

The track runs beside and over various steams, including the Waitomo Stream. Surrounded by lush green bush and large trees.

The highlight being views into various limestone caves created by the steam.

## Wednesday 9th July, Auckland and back, again

My lovely wife flies in today. Another day largely taken up with driving to and back from Auckland airport. Especially when leaving Auckland airport around 5pm, dealing with peak hour traffic, and taking a wrong turn. Close on 4 hours later a safe return "home".

## Thursday 10th July, Otorohanga

A settling in day. A bit of a sleep in, some reading, a tour of the temporary home, and orientation with the animals. Followed by a trip into Otorohanga for a walk and provisions. 70+mm of rain predicted for tomorrow, so expecting a day of doing nothing beyond watch the creeks rise.
