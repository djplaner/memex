Quick notes of travel in New Zealand in July 2025.

## Friday 4th July, Toowoomba to Otorohanga

Up early to drive into Brisbane for a solo Jetstar flight to Auckland. Surprisingly quick drive-in. Some issues actually checking in. My new passport and a plethora of David Jones led to some official uncertainty about my fitness to travel. After one of the "senior" check-in staff had a long call with some import customer service line I was passed fit to leave the country.

Tailwinds meant the flight arrived early into Auckland. However, we were delayed leaving the plane due to a medical emergency. A good twenty minutes before we were off the plane. Quick and easy through passport, luggage collection, and customs. With only a slight delay in duty free.

Met outside the gate by my sister for the drive to Otorohanga. A much longer drive due to the it being Friday around 5pm heading out of Auckland. Only required to prompt Jenny to brake before running up the rear end of someone. Curried, home-made sausages waiting for dinner. Followed by some chatting and bed.

Stomach was somewhat unsettled as I went to bed delaying and reducing the quality of sleep. Aided temporarily by a late night visit to the toilet. Signs that some sort of food poisoning or flu.

## Saturday 5th July, Otorohanga

After a fairly wet night and a reasonable sleep it was time to get the lay of the land. Jenny and Barry introducing the house, animals, gardens, and paddocks. Pointing out all the various tasks to be completed. 

Barry's mother's 80th birthday celebrations planned in the Hamilton area. Jenny and Barry had a bit to prepare before the headed off around 1pm. I did try some of Barry's mini-sausage rolls for "lunch". Stomach still upset. It remained rainy after they left so I retired to bed.

Around 4 I was feeling somewhat better and the sun had come out. Time for a drive into Otorohanga. Visit the local Woolies and take short walk around the "Giant Pukeko". A local park with a lake and a statue of a giant Pukeko. A local bird.

## Sunday 6th July, Back to Auckland and back

<caption>What do you want?</caption>
</figure>

The morning dawned clear and sunny. Sufficient for a quick walk out the front to check out the beasties. Main task for the day was dropping Barry, Jenny and Jonathon off at Auckland airport for the flights to Oz. ~2 hours there and back. Stomach still not great but some drugs used to help. Trip largely without incident, some delays on the way back due to an accident.

After almost 5 hours in the car and still feeling crook the rest of the day was spent reading [_Character Limit_](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/sep/18/character-limit-by-kate-conger-and-ryan-mac-review-musks-twitter-takeover) and trawling social media and the news. It was during the latter that I learned of the passing of Steve Munster. A good guy and great cricketer (esp. indoor) who I used to play cricket within the 90s. Commiserations to his family.

The rest of the evening to be spent figuring out what I can do tomorrow to get out and about a bit more.

## Monday 7th July, An easy day

</figure>

Another fine day, actually caught a bit of the sunrise.

Still not quite recovered. A quiet day spent reading. Some walking around the farm before a longer walk around Otorohanga in the afternoon before a kebab for dinner. The first "real" food for a couple of days.

Major issue was the newly "repaired" boots turning out not to be repaired. 

## Tuesday 8th July, 

The boot issue meant any decent length walking was off the agenda. Headed to the [Ruakuri Bushwalk](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/waikato/places/waitomo-area/tracks/ruakuri-walk/) which is only 20 minutes down the road. Great walk, but the dampness reinforced the need for decent boots.

A lightly graveled track with a fair bit of dampish mud led up and down hills and through bush. Much cooler than outside the bush.

The track runs beside and over various steams, including the Waitomo Stream. Surrounded by lush green bush and large trees.

The highlight being views into various limestone caves created by the steam.

## Wednesday 9th July, Auckland and back, again

My lovely wife flies in today. Another day largely taken up with driving to and back from Auckland airport. Especially when leaving Auckland airport around 5pm, dealing with peak hour traffic, and taking a wrong turn. Close on 4 hours later a safe return "home".

## Thursday 10th July, Otorohanga

A settling in day. A bit of a sleep in, some reading, a tour of the temporary home, and orientation with the animals. Followed by a trip into Otorohanga for a walk and provisions. 70+mm of rain predicted for tomorrow, so expecting a day of doing nothing beyond watch the creeks rise.

## Friday 11th July, Otorohanga

Day of heavier showers and rain. Long decided to stay entirely at home. Watched the 2024 movie _Civil War_ and episodes of _Squid Game_. Some reading.

## Saturday 12th July, Otorohanga

Another day of rain/showers and minimal activity. Did venture to town to get some provisions. Finished _Squid Game_ and various other distractions.

Did move the cattle to a new paddock due to sunnier weather. However, typical of the day our first foray to the cattle was aborted due to a heavy shower. Sun, shower followed each other the rest of the day. Took the opportunity to head up the hill closer to the boundary to get a better view.

## Sunday 13th July, Otorohanga, Te Awamutu, Yarndley's Bush and Lake Ngaroto 

Slow start to the day, looking like being a bit wetter than yesterday. The plan is to get out a bit more today, maybe. First some chores for the morning feeding some animals and cleaning up the chooks a touch. Spotted some of the "local wildlife" down the valley.

On the way back up the drive took struck by the lightly wooded hills clouded with mist.

</figure>

Around lunch time we headed off to Te Awamutu. Initially for a visit to [Yarndley's Bush](https://www.waipadc.govt.nz/your-waipa/parks-and-reserves/te-awamutu-parks-and-reserves/yarndleys-bush). A remnant of native  Kahikatea swamp forest. The ~150 year old Kahikatea trees are 30-35m tall.

</figure>

As a swamp forest the soil is very moist, thus limited oxygen for the roots. The trees have adapted by growing large buttress roots to support the tree and provide some oxygen.

From there we drove a short while to [Lake Ngaroto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Ngaroto). Nice for a brief stop, the big surprise was spotting some black swans.

## Monday 14th July, Ruakuri Bushwalk

Sandy had a couple of work calls scheduled and it was raining at times during the day. Hence mostly spent at home. However, we did manage the [Ruakuri Bushwalk](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/waikato/places/waitomo-area/tracks/ruakuri-walk/) after lunch. Sandy's first attempt. Followed by food shopping in Otorohanga. Home just in time for the rain to continue.

## Tuesday 15th July, Otorohanga

Another day of rain, another day indoors. This time with cooking. Sandy cooked another batch of dhal, I did some choc chip cookies. Tomorrow promises to be fine.

## Wednesday 16th July, Sanctuary Mountain Maungatautari

Spent most of the day (11:30am to 4:00pm) at [Sanctuary Mountain Maungatautari](https://www.sanctuarymountain.co.nz/). The intent being to explore more of native NZ bush. Almost all of the country side is green rolling hills given over to dairy cattle or sheep. What bush remains in odd pockets feels the impacts of mammals like possums, rats, and stoats. Not native to NZ.

</figure>

Sanctuary Mountain Maungatautari is a large ecological sanctuary based on [Maungatautari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maungatautari) an extinct volcano. Some 33,000+ hectares of mountain and forest surrounded by a 47km predator-proof fence. Once the fence was up significant effort was expended removing (killing) non-native animals within the fence. In their absence the native flora and fauna have thrived.

</figure>

There are kilometers of graveled walking tracks throughout the sanctuary. We spent almost all of our time wondering along different tracks. Also took in one of the available guided tours, a good introduction. Later in the day we walked through a collection of birds busy in the canopy. The highlight being a [North Island Kaka](http://djon.es/memex/sense/birdwatching/newZealandKaka.html) happily destroying a branch just above the path. Very happy to ignore us we watched. The [Kaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C4%81k%C4%81) is an endangered parrot native to New Zealand.

## Thursday 17th July, Otorohanga

Another day of rain and indoors. Nothing exciting.

## Friday 18th July, Hobbiton

The weather forecast was for rain clearing from late morning. It's been consistently reliable so we booked for a Hobbiton tour at midday. All went well with the weather and the tour was enjoyable. Sandy's highlight was entering a Hobbit hole and seeing the interior detail. In particular, the preserves. The level of detail was impressive.

With a bit more background on the books and the movies I enjoyed the outside more than Sandy. Afterward we watched the first Hobbit movie to help Sandy make connections.

The end of the tour was at the Green Dragon Inn with a free drink (cider for me, ginger beer for Sandy). Our last surprise of the tour were the free Stein due to there being construction work going on. Not that we were worried by it.

## Saturday 19th July, Raglan

A fine day with the promise of possible showers in the afternoon. Took the opportunity to head to Raglan to tick off a west coast seaside town, including the chance of fish and chips. Lovely drive, especially as we headed west toward Raglan. The road winding its way up and down hills toward the coast. Closer to Raglan we took advantage of the sign-posted "windfarm observation point".

<figure markdown>
![](https://djon.es/assets/memex/sense/Travel/nz-2025/windfarm.jpeg)
<caption>View from the windfarm observation point</caption>
</figure>

The provided information board included a map suggesting that the [Bridal Veil Falls walk](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/waikato/places/raglan-area/tracks/waireinga-bridal-veil-falls/) included the possibility of seeing the windfarm up closer. An apparent point of interest for my wife the Civil Engineer (on paper anyway). The plan was to head into Raglan first and then head to the falls. But sadly the weather was against us with the rain returning just as we left Raglan after lunch.

Before all that our first sight-seeing stop was Manu Bay Reserve just out of Raglan. Great views of the ocean, the west coast, and a long line of surfers. After this we headed back into Raglan for fish and chips on the wharf. The best fish and chips I've had in ages. Apparently the fish was fresh caught. Sandy reported her potato fritter was also top notch.
