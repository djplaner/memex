Collection of articles, web pages etc that I've at some stage marked to read.

## Current

### Design

- Manzini E (2015) Design, when everybody designs: an introduction to design for social innovation

### CAS

Oughton, E. J., Usher, W., Tyler, P., & Hall, J. W. (2018). Infrastructure as a Complex Adaptive System. *Complexity*, *2018*, e3427826. <https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/3427826>

  Five key theoretical propertise of CAS
  1. adaptive agents
  2. Diverse agents
  3. Dynamics
  4. Irreversibility
  5. Emergence

## Old

Much of this old stuff is simply outdated. From a time when I pretended to have an interest in higher education.

### BAD
