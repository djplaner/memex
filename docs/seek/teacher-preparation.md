# Teacher preparation

See also: [[seek]]

Goal is to prepare and get better at [[teaching-mathematics]] and [[teaching-digital-technologies]]

## Rationale

A good teacher has good [TPACK](https://djon.es/blog/2015/01/06/tpack-as-shared-practice-toward-a-research-agenda/#introduction) that is [distributed](https://djon.es/blog/2015/01/06/tpack-as-shared-practice-toward-a-research-agenda/#a-distributive-view-of-learning-and-knowledge). 

How to conceptualist that TPACK?

## Questions

- [ ] How to conceptualise what and how to develop "good TPACK" for teaching areas?
    - Curriculum
      - [ ] What is the structure of the national math curriculum? 
  - Discipline
  - Pedagogy/Learning design

- [ ] How can technologies specific to teacher education/practice (e.g. lesson and unit plan templates) be enhanced to increase distributive TPACK?
- [ ] Can the outputs of digital renovation practices by individual staff be shared?
