### To do

**NOW**

[[bird-life-list]] as part of broader [[wood-duck-observations]] work

Starting to generate 1st versions of iNaturalist observation files -- will have problems to resolve

- start work on iNaturalist import
  - examine the iNaturalist CSV export format
  - re-factor `importeBird.py` to be more generic - `importObservations.py`?
    - factor out specific eBird and iNaturalist functions into support libraries
  - integrate iNaturalist bird observations into existing bird life list
  - clarify the outputs for non-bird iNaturalist observations (plants, fauna?)
    - individual plant observations
    - plant species page how to interact with existing species pages
    - individual plant pages

Continue work on

- [[wood-duck-observations]] - early design

  - working on importeBird based on [[bubbles-as-objects]]
  - Need to figure out how it all fits together big picture
- [[photography]] particularly [[photoclass-2026]]

General work

- update the work history based on imported images
- start adding description to main pages 
- update template to display description information on pages
- start work on additional "activities"



- Ponder how work history might be linked to the fediverse - implement open graph
- [x] [[open-graph-per-page]]
- work history 
  - Allow it on individual pages?
  - most recent work history might be used on the region page?

Add an _observations_ approach that is similar to work history

  - Used when making observations of animals, individual plants, etc
  - rather than regions, it can be object type e.g. (plant, animal, bird etc)

Misc

- exclude work history files from backlink calculations
- [[creating-compost]]
- [[raised-garden-beds]]
- [[wikilinks-admonition-bug]]
- Looking at how to integrate zotero into memex
- blog statistics - posts / year - not ordered on year
- Thinking about the link between [[shadow-system]] and [[enshittification]]

On-going

- Process the [sense list](#sense)
- [[publishing-graph-interface]]
- ponder use of [webmention.io](https://webmention.io)

- Update the "Made with Material for Mkdocs" to be more [[some-assemblage-required]]
- work on [[assemblage]]
- navigation structure
- implement statistics
  - Blog - visual stats/ bar graphs
  - Memex - RSS recent changes

Memex tasks

- Re-design the home page for djon.es
  - alt/visible descriptions for images

Blog tasks

- Add figure markdown elements to images on the blog
- Fix never ending restart local `mkdocs serve`
