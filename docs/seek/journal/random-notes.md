# Random Notes

Place to jot random ideas for future consideration

## Computer science and orchestration 

Increasingly, LLMS are seen as requiring orchestration with other technologies.  Echoing on-going work around orchestration and ideas of [[bad_set-casa-gather-weave]]. Orchestration is also key to Fawns' [[entangled-pedagogy]]

What does the computer science, IS and other literature have to say about orchestration
