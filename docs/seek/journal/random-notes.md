# Random Notes 

Place to jot random ideas for future consideration

## Computer science and orchestration 

Increasingly, LLMS are seen as requiring orchestration with other technologies.  Echoing on-going work around [[orchestration]] and ideas of [[bad_set-casa-gather-weave]]. Orchestration is also key to Fawns' [[entangled-pedagogy]]

What does the computer science, IS and other literature have to say about orchestration

In fact, it appears chatbots are often positioned as helping orchestrate underlying services

## End-user programming 

Reflect on [this resource](https://www.inkandswitch.com/end-user-programming/)

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"

[bad_set-casa-gather-weave]: ../docs/sense/CASA/bad_set-casa-gather-weave "The relationships between BAD/SET, CASA, and Gather/Weave"
