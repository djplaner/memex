# David's personal memex

An on-going experiment in creating and leveraging a personal memex using [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/). The [[colophon]] offers some background on rationale and design.

Initially organised around a three step process (from [the Seek, Sense, Share Framework](https://jarche.com/2014/02/the-seek-sense-share-framework/)), but playing with other structures.

| PKM Phase | Description |
| --- | --- | 
| [[seek]] | Very incomplete thinking about how and what I try to seek out to include here. |
| [[sense]] | The main collection of inter-connected "notes", ideas and other rambles |
| [[share]] | Collection of pointers to the more polished artefacts I've produced |

!!! info "Slowly integrating _Material for MkDocs_"

    The memex is slowly being migrated to use [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). 
    
    Look!! There's a search facility now!!!
