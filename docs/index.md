# David's personal memex

An on-going experiment in creating and leveraging a personal memex using [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/). The [[colophon]] offers some background on rationale and design.

Currently organised around a three step process (from [the Seek, Sense, Share Framework](https://jarche.com/2014/02/the-seek-sense-share-framework/))

1. [[seek]] out new information
2. Make [[sense]] it
3. [[share]] artefacts.

!!! info "Slowly integrating _Material for MkDocs_"

    The memex is slowly being migrated to use [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). 
    
    Look!! There's a search facility now!!!
