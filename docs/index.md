# DJ's personal memex

An on-going experiment in creating and leveraging a personal memex using [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/). Some background on rationale and design.

Currently organised around a three step process

1. [[seek-docs]] out new information
2. Make [[sense-docs]] it
3. [[share-docs]] artefacts.

## Others places
