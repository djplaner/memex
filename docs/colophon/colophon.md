# Colophon

[Colophon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colophon_(publishing)), a fancy term for sharing information about the publication of this "book". A way to track the thinking behind the evolution of this site.

!!! info "Version 2.0 - Foam + Material for MkDocs"

    Version 2.0 combines [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) - to improve the user-interface for navigation/reading - with the Obsidian/Roam/Notion type authoring/curating functionality provided by [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) 
    
    Timed with an increased focus on leveraging this site for my [personal learning environment](https://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=71058)
