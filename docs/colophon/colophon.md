This [[digital-garden]] serves [the author's](https://djon.es/blog/about-2/) personal knowledge management ([[pkm]]) and publishing needs. See below for the how, why, and evolution of this site. [[related-work|Related work]] for more of the inspiration for this work.

## Why?

The original intent was inspired by Vannevar Bush [writing in 1945](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_We_May_Think) about a device he called Memex as

> a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.

This site isn't going to do all of that. But it is an attempt to be more considered about how I seek, make sense of and share knowledge.

[A 2020 blog post](https://djon.es/blog/2020/07/06/designing-a-personal-memex-with-foam/) gives some origins for this work. I might think and write more about this and the connection with [[ideas-events-people]]

An on-going task is to figure out [[note-taking-strategies]] to help improve this site and turn it into a more effective [[digital-garden]]. 

A significant part of this work is the on-going selection and orchestration of different technologies to implement this version of Memex. The impact of the how and what of this orchestration is visible in [[as-we-may-think|Bush's writing]] and [[drons-technology|other conceptualisations of technology]] in general.

## How?

See also: [[some-assemblage-required]]

[Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) - a plugin for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - is used ot edit [Markdown files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). Foam provides Roam/Obsidian style note-taking and personal knowledge management functionality. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) provides version control of the Markdown files with a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/djplaner/memex) currently the authoritative source for the content.

The [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme for [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) - a Python-based static site generator - transforms the Markdown files into HTML. Extra content is generated by [[computational-components]] - bespoke Python scripts - which read and modify the Markdown files prior to publishing. Numerous other [MkDocs projects and plugins](https://github.com/mkdocs/catalog?tab=readme-ov-file#----catalog----) provide additional functionality (e.g. Mathematics, [lightbox](https://github.com/blueswen/mkdocs-glightbox?tab=readme-ov-file#mkdocs-glightbox) etc.).

Other functionality includes:

- Site search is provided [PageFind](https://pagefind.app/).
- Analytics provided by [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/).

Beyond the technology are the [[note-taking-strategies]] and [[digital-garden]] practices that I'm slowly startign to use properly.

!!! note "Always emerging out of bricolage"

    This is not a pre-planned site. Instead emerging out of bricolage as I learn and discover new tools.

    i.e. it isn't polished and probably helps me more in thinking than any reader. 

### Dev, test, and build process

**Development** takes place on my Mac laptop within a local git repo of [Memex](https://github.com/djplaner/memex). Markdown files edited using VSCode with Foam and other extensions. Changes are committed with meaningful and semi-detailed comments that end up on the site via [[recent-changes]].

**Testing** is done locally using `mkdocs serve` to run up the site locally. With some semi-automated copying of search files to enable site search to work during testing.

**Building** the site is done using a shell script which

- Generates static HTML files in the `../memex_site` folder using `mkdocs build`.
- Generates static search files using `python -m pagefind --site ../memex_site`.
- Copies the static HTML files to the live site.

### To do list

Improvements being worked on or thought about, include:

- [[move-images-out-of-git]] - move images out of the git repo and into a shared assets folder.
- [[publishing-graph-interface]] - adding an interface option to navigate the inter-connected bubbles of the site using a network graph.
- [[statistics-and-analytics]] - exploring how to improve statistics and analytics for the site and the blog.
- [[comments-webmentions]] and/or [[add-activity-pub]] - have the blog post/retrieve comments via ActivityPub.
- expand [[recent-changes]]

    - Stand alone page that lists all changes, provides graphical representations of frequency etc.

Completed

- [[improve-static-search]] - replace the default MkDocs search with a lighter-weight search engine.
- [[add-a-mathematics-template]] to include MathJax when required.



## Evolution


The following tracks the broad evolution of the method behind the implementation of this site through the following phases

1. [Version 3 - early 2025](#version-3-early-2025)
2. [Version 2 - Adding mkdocs - (2nd half 2023)](#version-2-adding-mkdocs-2nd-half-2023)
3. [Version 1 - Initial implementation with Foam using PKM (July 2020)](#version-1-initial-implementation-with-foam-using-pkm-july-2020)

### Version 3 - early 2025

Details on version 3 covered in [[version-3-memex-design]]. Initial work is complete.

- early [blog post](https://djon.es/blog/2025/01/12/what-now/) with initial description of the rationale and possibilities for version 3.
- [A new day](https://djon.es/blog/2025/05/23/a-new-day/) authored using the new process for the new blog, this post steps through the process. 

Where [[computational-components]] started being heavily used.

- [x] [[integrate-backlinks-automatically-onto-pages]] completed June 2025

### Version 2 - Adding mkdocs - (2nd half 2023)

- August 20 - [[why-mkdocs-foam]]
- August 26 - [[deploy-with-github-action]]
- November 11 - [[tags-and-properties]] 

Version 2.0 combines [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) - to improve the user-interface for navigation/reading - with the Obsidian/Roam/Notion type authoring/curating functionality provided by [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) 
    
Timed with an increased focus on leveraging this site for my [personal learning environment](https://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=71058)

### Version 1 - Initial implementation with Foam using PKM (July 2020)

- July 6 - [Early design](https://djon.es/blog/2020/07/06/designing-a-personal-memex-with-foam/)

### Failed or ceased work

- [[possible-foam-svelte]] - very early thinking about using SvelteKit from when I was tinkering with Svelte. The rapidly changing nature of Svelte (and Javascript in general) and my Python familiarity put pay to this idea.
