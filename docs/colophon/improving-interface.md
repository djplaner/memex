title: Improving memex's interface
type: note
---
As it stood, memex was using a fairly standard [Material for Mkdocs interface](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/) (i.e. one ripped entirely from Material for MkDocs). Aim here is to spend some time developing the interface into something more purposeful for memex.

Major tasks

- 
- [Home page changes](#home-page-changes)
- New interface for blog section 
- Update interface for main memex section
    - Maybe look at a different design for different sections (e.g. wood duck meadows)

## Home page changes

Some initial tweaks to the home page

- [x] Replace the current seek/sense/share structure as home page
- [ ] Update navigation

    - How to keep on-page navigation whilst remove top frame?
    - Ponder [awesome-nav](https://lukasgeiter.github.io/mkdocs-awesome-nav/)
- [x] Add "Recent changes" section - updated from git commits

        Use git commit logs

Look to support my own sense-making/record keeping and to help keep family informed. Secondary purpose provide information that others may find useful.
