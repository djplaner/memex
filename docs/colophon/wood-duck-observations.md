description: Computational component to gather observations of animals, birds, insects, etc and weave and augment that information on this site.

## Purpose

With an interest in [[regeneration]] of the [[wood-duck-meadows]] ecosystem comes the desire to make and track various observations about the flora and fauna that inhabit the area. Beyond simply making and recording the observations the desire is to computationally weave and augment observational information to achieve different purposes.

## Questions and tasks

- What purpose(s) do we need to support - somewhat open ended, but need one or two to get going
    - bird life list
        - Update [[life-list-generator]] to not work on the CSV file and photographs. Replace photographs with markdown files that include images? Work with both?
    - plants and individual plants
        - observations are linked to individual plants
        - plant pages will need to link to individual plants of same species
- Converters will probably have to draw on downloaded CSV - no live data feed? 
- Where do the converters fit within the pipeline
    - before mkdocs as with current eBird?
    - implemented into mkdocs pipeline - where?

## Conceptual Design

- Entry and storage options
    - Markdown files - hand written using Foam/VSCode
    - external data sources - require "converters" to transform original data into markdown files
      - eBird - provides a downloadable CSV 
      - iNaturalist
- Display
    - [[life-list-generator]] (not a [[computational-component]]) generates life list, life list gallery and individual bird species pages
    - Generate pages for individual observations for sharing on social media
    - Provide a macro that allows grouping together observations of a specific type into another page
        - Species page (for flora or fauna) that lists all observations of that species
        - Region page that lists all observations made in that region
        - Individual plant pages that list all observations made of that plant

## Data design

Each observation has a markdown file with following possible front matter fields that can be used for searching and filtering:

- type: observation
- observation-type: e.g. bird, insect, mammal, plant, fungi, etc
- title and other metadata a possible search
- use of tags 

Enabling macros like

```markdown
{{ observations('gatton-creek-frontage') }}
```

## Draft thinking

- link to the eBird stuff
- How to link to eBird and iNaturalist
- not just Markdown files in a particular folder
- multiple outputs??
    - link observations to regions
