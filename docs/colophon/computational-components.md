title: Computational components
type: note
---

A lot of the "Second Brain" ideas focus on people gathering and weaving content. Most software supporting this work provides various computational means to automate aspects of [[pkm|personal knowledge management]]. For example, [Obsidian plugins](https://obsidian.md/plugins) or how [Josh Comeau uses MDX](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/how-i-built-my-blog-v2/#content-management-2) to create interactive components by combining Markdown and JSX through use of MDX. Computational components is the label I'm using for this work.

Currently the computational components are implemented using Python and using a couple of [MkDocs plugins](https://github.com/mkdocs/catalog?tab=readme-ov-file#----catalog----) (see [method](#methods) below).

!!! note "🚧  Just a bit more? 🚧"

    There is a vague intent that computational components help with more than just maintaining a Memex (Second Brain).


## Current computational components

- 🚧 Wood duck meadows work history 🚧

    [[wood-duck-work-history]] is an approach by which [[regeneration]] work performed on [[wood-duck-meadows]] is recorded and displayed. Perhaps at a latter stage, something a little more is done.

- [wood-duck-gallery](../sense/landscape-garden/wood-duck-gallery.md)
 
    The ([[wood-duck-gallery-generator]]) gathers all the photos from the zone and plant pages for [[wood-duck-meadows]]. Implemented using `mkdoc-gen-files` to integrate a Python script into `mkdocs`

- [life-list-gallery](../sense/birdwatching/life-list-gallery.md)

    [[life-list-generator]] is a stand alone Python script (**TODO** integrate using `mkdocs-gen-files`) generates the life list gallery from a combination of eBird CSV file download and images saved locally.

- [[recent-changes]] 
    read git commit log to display recent website updates

    Python script to generate JSON and Javascript to generate HTML, or Python script to replace bound text in a markdown file.

- 🚧 [[plant-location-generator]] 🚧 

    Early experiment to extract plant location data from plant photos.

- Various different functions as part of the [[convert-wordpress-into-memex]] process

    Category and archive pages, RSS feeds, and blog statistics are being generated using Python scripts.

- [[blog-statistics]]

    Generate and display statistics about the content of the blog.

- Corpus Actions

    Early work on a component to perform actions on the entire corpus of bubbles. Initial work done implementing [[integrate-backlinks-automatically-onto-pages]]

- **Planned** Website network map

    Generate a public website version of [Foam's graph feature](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/user/features/graph-visualization).


## Methods

Possible methods might include:

- Python scripts to generate entire markdown files.

    Run before `mkdocs build` these scripts would take data from various locations (external sources, existing markdown/image files in this repo, etc.) and write markdown files.
- Javascript to generate content from JSON files.

    Run when a HTML page is viewed in a browser the Javascript would transform JSON files generated by other means (e.g. Python scripts) from the repo.

    Given mkdocs is a static site generator, this approach might clash somewhat with outlook.

- Python scripts update bound text within markdown text.

    Python scripts look for specific tags within a markdown file and aim to replace that.

The main distinction appears to be the Javascript is useful when wanting the component to add a small amount to an existing file.

## mkdocs methods

The mkdocs community has already faced this issue. Some related resources, include:

- [Dynamic content generation](https://yodamad.hashnode.dev/some-cool-plugins-for-your-mkdocs-based-site#heading-dynamic-content-generation)

    Blog post with section on using [`mkdocs-gen-files`](https://oprypin.github.io/mkdocs-gen-files/index.html) plugin that provides a method to build this work into site generation. Works by generating entire markdown files (that are in a tmp position and not available in the `docs` folder)

- `mkdocs-gen-files` suggests [`mkdocs-macros-plugin`](https://mkdocs-macros-plugin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) as a way to generate content within a markdown file.
