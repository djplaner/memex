Most content on this (and associated sites) site is produced via manual editing of Markdown files. However, some content may be better generated dynamically through computation.  **Computational components** is the label for such work.

As practiced here it's a primitive alternative to how [Josh Comeau uses MDX](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/how-i-built-my-blog-v2/#content-management-2) to create interactive components by combining Markdown and JSX through use of MDX.

## Examples

- [wood-duck-gallery](../sense/landscape-garden/wood-duck-gallery.md)
 
    The ([[wood-duck-gallery-generator]]) gathers all the photos from the zone and plant pages for [[wood-duck-meadows]]. Implemented using `mkdoc-gen-files` to integrate a Python script into `mkdocs`

- [[life-list-gallery]] 

    [[life-list-generator]] is a stand alone Python script (**TODO** integrate using `mkdocs-gen-files`) generates [[life-list-gallery]] from a combination of eBird CSV file download and images saved locally.

- [[recent-changes]] 
    read git commit log to display recent website updates

    Python script to generate JSON and Javascript to generate HTML, or Python script to replace bound text in a markdown file.

- [[plant-location-generator]]

    Early experiment to extract plant location data from plant photos.

- Various different functions as part of the [[convert-wordpress-into-memex]] process

    Category and archive pages, RSS feeds, and blog statistics are being generated using Python scripts.

- **Planned** Website network map

    Generate a public website version of [Foam's graph feature](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/user/features/graph-visualization).


## Methods

Possible methods might include:

- Python scripts to generate entire markdown files.

    Run before `mkdocs build` these scripts would take data from various locations (external sources, existing markdown/image files in this repo, etc.) and write markdown files.
- Javascript to generate content from JSON files.

    Run when a HTML page is viewed in a browser the Javascript would transform JSON files generated by other means (e.g. Python scripts) from the repo.

    Given mkdocs is a static site generator, this approach might clash somewhat with outlook.

- Python scripts update bound text within markdown text.

    Python scripts look for specific tags within a markdown file and aim to replace that.

The main distinction appears to be the Javascript is useful when wanting the component to add a small amount to an existing file.

## mkdocs methods

The mkdocs community has already faced this issue. Some related resources, include:

- [Dynamic content generation](https://yodamad.hashnode.dev/some-cool-plugins-for-your-mkdocs-based-site#heading-dynamic-content-generation)

    Blog post with section on using [`mkdocs-gen-files`](https://oprypin.github.io/mkdocs-gen-files/index.html) plugin that provides a method to build this work into site generation. Works by generating entire markdown files (that are in a tmp position and not available in the `docs` folder)

- `mkdocs-gen-files` suggests [`mkdocs-macros-plugin`](https://mkdocs-macros-plugin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) as a way to generate content within a markdown file.
