Most content on this site is produced via manual editing of Markdown files. However, some content may be better generated by computation. "Computational components" is a label for how this might be done. 

## Methods

Possible methods might include:

- Python scripts to generate entire markdown files.

    Run before `mkdocs build` these scripts would take data from various locations (external sources, existing markdown/image files in this repo, etc.) and write markdown files.
- Javascript to generate content from JSON files.

    Run when a HTML page is viewed in a browser the Javascript would transform JSON files generated by other means (e.g. Python scripts) from the repo.

    Given mkdocs is a static site generator, this approach might clash somewhat with outlook.

- Python scripts update bound text within markdown text.

    Python scripts look for specific tags within a markdown file and aim to replace that.

The main distinction appears to be the Javascript is useful when wanting the component to add a small amount to an existing file.

## Examples

- "Recent changes" - _planned_
    read git commit log to display recent website updates

    Python script to generate JSON and Javascript to generate HTML, or Python script to replace bound text in a markdown file.

- "Photo gallery" 
    Generate photo gallery for a specific set of photos existing within the repo.

    Examples include

    - [[life-list-generator]] includes an initial example by generating the [[life-list-gallery]]. The idea would be to generalise this a little more. Examples might include 

        - Gallery of all photos in a given folder (recursing down)
        - Gallery of all photos with specific metadata (either in the file content or by other means)

    - Wood duck meadows gallery - Gallery of all [[wood-duck-meadows]] photos.

        - Update image markdown to include `data-name` and `data-description` used by glightbox extension
        - Group the photos by Wood duck meadows zones and plant types?


## Working examples

- [[life-list-generator]] - Python script to generate a birding [[life-list]] from a CSV export from the eBird app.

## mkdocs methods

The mkdocs community has already faced this issue. Some related resources, include:

- [Dynamic content generation](https://yodamad.hashnode.dev/some-cool-plugins-for-your-mkdocs-based-site#heading-dynamic-content-generation)

    Blog post with section on using [`mkdocs-gen-files`](https://oprypin.github.io/mkdocs-gen-files/index.html) plugin that provides a method to build this work into site generation. Works by generating entire markdown files (that are in a tmp position and not available in the `docs` folder)

- `mkdocs-gen-files` suggests `mkdocs-macros-plugin` as a way to generate content within a markdown file.
