Most content on this site is produced via manual editing of Markdown files. However, some content may be better generated by computation. "Computational components" is a label for how this might be done. 

## Methods

Possible methods might include:

- Python scripts to generate entire markdown files.

    Run before `mkdocs build` these scripts would take data from various locations (external sources, existing markdown/image files in this repo, etc.) and write markdown files.
- Javascript to generate content from JSON files.

    Run when a HTML page is viewed in a browser the Javascript would transform JSON files generated by other means (e.g. Python scripts) from the repo.

    Given mkdocs is a static site generator, this approach might clash somewhat with outlook.

- Python scripts update bound text within markdown text.

    Python scripts look for specific tags within a markdown file and aim to replace that.

The main distinction appears to be the Javascript is useful when wanting the component to add a small amount to an existing file.

## Possible examples

- "Recent changes" read git commit log to display recent website updates

    Python script to generate JSON and Javascript to generate HTML, or Python script to replace bound text in a markdown file.

- "Photo gallery" - generate photo gallery for a specific set of photos existing within the repo.

    [[life-list-generator]] includes an initial example by generating the [[life-list-gallery]]. The idea would be to generalise this a little more. Examples might include 

        - Gallery of all photos in a given folder (recursing down)
        - Gallery of all photos with specific metadata (either in the file content or by other means)

## Working examples

- [[life-list-generator]] - Python script to generate a birding [[life-list]] from a CSV export from the eBird app.

## Development tasks

- [ ] Integrate running of computational components into the build process.

    `mkdocs` both as `serve` and `build`

- [ ] Explore how existing mkdocs community does this

    - There is a [swagger render plugin](https://pypi.org/project/mkdocs-render-swagger-plugin/) for mkdocs. It implements something like the "bound" text approach

- [ ] Identify a "component" based approach to the HTML and Javascript that these would generate

## mkdocs methods

The mkdocs community has already faced this issue. Some related resources, include:

- [Dynamic content generation](https://yodamad.hashnode.dev/some-cool-plugins-for-your-mkdocs-based-site#heading-dynamic-content-generation)

    Blog post with section on using `mkdocs-gen-files` plugin that provides a method to build this work into site generation.
