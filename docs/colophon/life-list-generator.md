A [[life-list]] is a list of all the species of birds that a birder has seen. I've been using [eBird](https://ebird.org/home) to maintain a list. This converts an eBird data export into a collection of pages.

## Input

### eBird data

CSV file with the following columns (placed in folder)

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Submission Id | Unique identifier for the observation |
| Common Name | The common name of the bird |
| Scientific Name | The scientific name of the bird |
| Taxonomic Order | Numeric ID representing the order? |
| Count | Number of birds seen (if available) |
| State/Province | The state or province where the observation was made |
| County | Council area |
| LocationID | Numeric id for location (unique) |
| Location | Name of location |
| Latitude | Latitude of location |
| Longitude | Longitude of location |
| Date | Date of observation |
| Time | Time of observation |
| Protocol | String description/label of method |
| Duration | Duration of observation |
| All Obs Reported | All observations reported? |
| ...and others | |

### Photos

Birds are added to the list if I've taken personal photos. Photos stored in the `images` folder. File name the full name of the bird (from eBird) camel case with a number on the end.

## Output

Life list page be a table with the following columns
- Name

    Where the name is a link to another page contain details about the observations and photos
- # of observations
- days since last observation

Individual bird pages

- based on name of bird
- uses Glightbox to display photos of birds

## Design

- Run from `utils/generator/life-list.py`
- `getLifeList` - parse the CSV life list
- `getPhotos` - identify the photos matching
- `writeLifeList` - over write the Markdown file
- `writeBirdPages` - write the individual bird pages
