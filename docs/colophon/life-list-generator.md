[Python script](https://github.com/djplaner/memex/blob/master/util/lifeList.py) to generate a birding [[life-list]] (and a [[life-list-gallery]]) from an [eBird](https://ebird.org/home) CSV file and a collection of relevant photos. 

- Populate a data frame with both the eBird and image data
    - Each bird species has a folder (named for the bird) in the images folder. Images in the folders are named with the eBird submission ID followed by numbers (for duplicates)
- Generate markdown files for individual birds and relevant life lists
- Modify table to split _Observation_ into _Where_ and _When_

## To do

- Add next/previous navigation on bird pages

    Individual bird pages should include a next/previous navigation to allow for easy browsing
- Organise life list by year
- Provide some summary statistics
