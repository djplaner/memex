[Python script](https://github.com/djplaner/memex/blob/master/util/generators/lifeList.py) to generate a birding [[life-list]] and a [[life-list-gallery]] from an [eBird](https://ebird.org/home) CSV file and a collection of relevant photos. 

## History

Originally implemented as a stand alone Python script to be run manually. Now updated to be integrated into the `mkdocs` process through the use of `mkdocs-gen-files` moving to a _[[computational-components]]_ approach.

## Purpose

Take two inputs placed within a specific folder within memex

1. eBird life list CSV; and,
2. a collection of images.

Generate three types of markdown files:

1. LIFE_LIST_PAGE: Markdown file containing table with data about all birds in the life list.
2. GALLERY_PAGE: Markdown file providing a gallery of all bird images.
3. Individual bird pages: Each bird with photos gets its own markdown file in the LIFE_LIST_FOLDER with the bird's name in camelCase

## Manual set up

1. Obtain and update the eBird life list CSV file.

    Login into eBird site and download CSV file. Coping it into memex

## To do

Bird pages

- Provide additional information about birds on bird pages
- Improve navigation between bird pages

Life list

- pre-sort life list table by # of photos
- Organise life list by year
- Provide some summary statistics

## Dev log

### mkdocs-gen-files

Change the path for files and add the script to the `mkdocs.yml` file and it's sort of working.

Initial issue is that the modifications to the different bird pages is causing `mkdocs serve` to continually restart. First attempted solution is to use `mkdocs_gen_files.open` to write the files. It seems to have worked.
