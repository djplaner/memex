## Why?

Purpose - explain why and what about the move from Wordpress to markdown

- Blog started in 2006 using Wordpress, moved to self-hosted Wordpress in ???
- Stuck with wordpress mainly through inertia
- Come to 2025 and combination of perceived issues and time to do something about it [[version-3-memex-design]]

Three issues

1. Wordpress is heavyweight and performance not there 
2. The editing interface (how we manipulate the content) is limited to the Wordpress interface
3. "social issues" - Having to rely on Wordpress - external person

## Limitations

- outdated content, broken links, outdated formats/online services
- Wordpress specific "markup" e.g. `[code lang=""] [/code]`

## How?

### Creating separate Foam instance

Initial work intended to include blog content within this site, but as the thousands of blog posts/pages were added performance by [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) significantly degraded. Hence a decision to make a blog specific Foam instance, which would

- Have a separate git repo.

- Use a combination for Foam and Material for mkdocs

- Use a blog specific template

Process

1. [Getting started with Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/#getting-started)

    - [x] Create a new Github repo using the provided template
    - [x] Clone the repo locally
    - [x] Configure vscode

2. Configure Material for MkDocs

    - [x] Create a requirements.txt
        - Start from [here](https://github.com/Jackiexiao/foam-mkdocs-template/blob/master/requirements.txt) and update
    - [x] Create a [virtual environment for Python](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)
    - [x] Install the modules
    - [x] Create a mkdocs.yml file
    - [x] Local server running

3. Create content 

    - Edit/create Markdown files in the `docs` folder.
    - [ ] Add old blog posts and pages

4. Additional configuration

    - Create [Foam templates](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/user/features/note-templates)

        - Template for blog posts, pages?
        - Using Foam variables, FILE_PATH based on dates

    - Custom templates for mkdocs
    - mkdocs generators and filters
