## Why?

Purpose - explain why and what about the move from Wordpress to markdown

- Blog started in 2006 using Wordpress, moved to self-hosted Wordpress in ???
- Stuck with wordpress mainly through inertia
- Come to 2025 and combination of perceived issues and time to do something about it [[version-3-memex-design]]

Three issues

1. Wordpress is heavyweight and performance not there 
2. The editing interface (how we manipulate the content) is limited to the Wordpress interface
3. "social issues" - Having to rely on Wordpress - external person

## Limitations

- outdated content
- ??
