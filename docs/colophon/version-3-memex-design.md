Time for this site to evolve for [reasons explained here](https://djon.es/blog/2025/01/12/what-now/). More detail on how and what was done will appear here.

## Stages

1. [x] [[from-github-to-djones]]

    Reduce reliance on cloud services (e.g. github) and move to self-hosting, which also unifies my websites **DONE**

       - ☑  Memex now being published on my personal URL [https://djon.es/memex/](https://djon.es/memex/)
       - ☑  Old github pages site redirects to the new URL

3. [ ] [[improving-interface]] 

    Including re-do the home page

       - [x]  Move away from seek/sense/share
       - Improve navigation
          - top, left, and right
       - Transform interface (move away from mkdocs default)

4. [ ] Adopting [[computational-components]]

    - [x] [[wood-duck-gallery-generator]]
    - [x] [[plant-location-generator]]

5. [ ] [[convert-wordpress-into-memex]]

    Import content from Wordpress blog [djon.es/blog](https://djon.es/blog)
