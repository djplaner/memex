title: Add a mathematics template
type: note
---
[MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org) is included in the base Memex template to allow the use of mathematics in the Markdown files (e.g. [[surds]]). The drawback is that it is the largest external file loaded by the site. Given that mathematics are only used on a subset of pages, it would be better to only load MathJax when required.

## Design

The initial idea is to define a mathematics template which includes MathJax and modify the mathematics pages to use this template.



[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[surds]: ../sense/Teaching/Mathematics/mathCK/surds "Surds - mathematical content knowledge"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
