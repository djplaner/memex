# Integrate backlinks automatically onto pages

Remove the need for "see also" and better allow navigation through structure - by adding to a page links back to pages that link to the current page

## Example

See [lzrd.dev](https://lzrd.dev/)


## Tools

[Foam-template and materialised-backlinks](https://jackiexiao.github.io/foam/reference/materialized-backlinks/) - not started - which actually seems to be just a one off translation of the Foam documentation into MkDocs
