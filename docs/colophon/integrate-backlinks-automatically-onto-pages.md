title: Integrate backlinks automatically onto pages
type: note
---
For much of the life of this site, I've manually added ["backlinks"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlink) to pages in the form of "See also:". The intent being to help make these connections explicit and ease navigation. The automated inclusion of backlinks has long been a core feature of wikis and is [supported by Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/user/features/backlinking) (the tool I use) in the authoring process. But Foam is agnostic about publishing and my method did not support backlinks.

Until June 2025. Automatic creation and visualisation of backlinks is now integrated into this site through a [[computational-components|computational component]]. A bit of Python that generates backlinks for each page and adds them to the frontmatter of the page. The backlinks are then rendered in the page template. See above.

## Impact

Apart from removing the need for manual "see also" work, this should also remove the "pollution" of those "see also" links from the site's network graph. The following two figures offer a comparison. While (IMHO) recognisably the same graph, the second graph is cleaner. With numerous network structures formed by the "see also" links no longer visible.

Would be good to do some actual graph analysis to explore the difference further.

## Sources of inspiration

See [lzrd.dev](https://lzrd.dev/memex/athena). Authored with Foam, [publishsed using 11ty](https://gitlab.com/lzrddev/athena) which adds backlinks.

Obsidian (somewhat equivalent to Foam) [supports backlinks](https://www.notion.com/help/create-links-and-backlinks). Also shows Obsidian's nice interface for backlinks. A crafted bullet list/almost drop down menu of backlinks.

## Design and implementation

Use some form of [[computational-components|computational component]] to generate backlinks for each page, implemented as part of [`corpusActions.py`](https://github.com/djplaner/memex/blob/master/util/generators/corpusActions.py) using this method:

1. `corpusActions.py` (implemented using the `mkdocs-gen-files` plugin) 
    ```python
    bubbles = retrieveMemexBubbles()
    backLinks = generateBackLinks(bubbles)
    updateFrontMatterBackLinks(bubbles, backLinks)
    ```

2. site content (Jinja) template checks for backlinks in the frontmatter and adds the necessary visual element.

```python
bubbles = retrieveMemexBubbles()
backLinks = generateBackLinks(bubbles)
updateFrontMatterBackLinks(bubbles, backLinks)
```
