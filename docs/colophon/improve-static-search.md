[[comparing-wordpress-to-memex|Comparing Wordpress to Memex]] revealed that the MkDocs static search's payload (14 Mb) significantly increases the size of the web pages. Look into alternatives - server side or client. Also, [lunr.js](https://github.com/olivernn/lunr.js/) used by MkDocs hasn't been updated recently (5-7 years).

## Alternatives

[PageFind](https://pagefind.app) - client site static site search designed to work well with large sites.

Looked at a few others, but PageFind appears the most recent and functional of the available options.

### Example uses of page find

- [Bryce Wray](https://www.brycewray.com/search/) - uses a separate search page
- [Sebastian Proost](https://blog.4dcu.be/programming/2022/08/27/pagefind.html) - modal for search 

## Early test with Page Find

Runs after SSG and outputs static search bundle to the generated site. Comes with a Python wrapper. Quick analysis with Lighthouse gives the following results - Page Find is faster than lunr.js (the MkDocs search). It also shows that perhaps Lighthouse analysis is not perfect. However, the difference is sufficient to try a full scale implementation.

| Site config | Performance Local | Performance Remote|
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| MkDocs with no search | 96 | 96 |
| MkDocs with lunr.js search | 80 |
| MkDocs with Page Find search | 97 |

## Migration to Page Find

Seems to involve the following steps:

- [x] Modify the MkDocs configuration to remove the lunr.js search plugin.
- [ ] Modify the MkDocs themes to include the Page Find search interface.
- [ ] Add the Page Find build step at the MkDocs build.
- [ ] Make any additional changes required.

### Additional changes

- [Configure the indexing](https://pagefind.app/docs/indexing/)

[Configure the ui](https://pagefind.app/docs/ui-usage/)

[Explore config of metadata](https://pagefind.app/docs/metadata/), in particular to get the displayed images to work (not absolute). [This](https://blog.4dcu.be/programming/2022/08/27/pagefind.html) mentions one need to fix images.
