A [[computational-component]] (example of [[gather-weave-augment]]) which takes individual records of work on [[wood-duck-meadows]] into region specific lists. For example, see [[gatton-creek-frontage|Gatton Creek frontage's work history]]

## Implementation

Individual work records are stored as markdown files in ```sense/landscape-garden/work-files/``` with the type set to `work-history`. Each file contains front matter fields including date and region where the work was done. The content of the file describes the work done.

The ```workHistory``` macro is available to be included in any Markdown file. When passed a region's name it generates a list of work history grouped by year and month.

## Design

### Requirements

Record the daily work done with links to the relevant regions and plants.

Display the information in different ways, including:

- Each region maintains a "history" section summarising the relevant work.
- Eventually have a Wood duck history page that enables interactive exploration of the work done across the entire site. Including queries based on region and date.

### Implementation

Data entry

- Maintain a folder with a index page linking to individual files for any day where work is done.

Data use

- Regions computational component (macro)

    Parse the work files and develop a list of work done for the region. This is then displayed on the region page.

- landscape-garden/wood-duck-meadows/wood-duck-work-history.md

    Generated by the computational component after reading the work files

- region pages

    Work history table for the given region.

Data

- landscape-garden/wood-duck-meadows/work-files/

    Folder that contains individual markdown files for each day work is done. Files organised into years.

- landscape-garden/wood-duck-meadows/work-files/<yyyy>/<filename>.md

    Individual markdown file for work on a day/time period. Frontmatter will contain a collection of specific information (date/time period, region, ???). Content is the description 


| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Date | Date of the work done a date field or range |
| Region | Name of the region(s) where the work was done. |

Code

- Class `workHistory` to read all the work history data

    Provide an iterator to iterate in various ways through the work history data. Utility class for other code.

- macro `regionWorkHistory`

    Passed the name of a region, generate the table work history to add to the region page.

- macro `woodDuckWorkHistory`

    Generate the work history page for Wood duck meadows. 

### corpus.py

A class to ready the work history, but eventually become something used by corpusActions.


```python
from util.corpus import corpus
workHistory = corpus( type="<type>")

## iterate through the work history
for work in workHistory:
    print(work.date, work.region, work.description)
```
