Method to [[gather-weave-augment]] the work history of [[wood-duck-meadows]]

## Design

### Requirements

Record the daily work done with links to the relevant regions and plants.

Display the information in different ways, including:

- Each region maintains a "history" section summarising the relevant work.
- Eventually have a Wood duck history page that enables interactive exploration of the work done across the entire site. Including queries based on region and date.

### Implementation

Data entry

- Maintain a folder with a index page linking to individual files for any day where work is done.

Data use

- Regions computational component (macro)

    Parse the work files and develop a list of work done for the region. This is then displayed on the region page.
