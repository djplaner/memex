Method to [[gather-weave-augment]] the work history of [[wood-duck-meadows]]

## Implementation plan

- [ ] Create the data
- [ ] Implement utility class
- [ ] Implement `regionWorkHistory`
- [ ] Implement `woodDuckWorkHistory`

## Design

### Requirements

Record the daily work done with links to the relevant regions and plants.

Display the information in different ways, including:

- Each region maintains a "history" section summarising the relevant work.
- Eventually have a Wood duck history page that enables interactive exploration of the work done across the entire site. Including queries based on region and date.

### Implementation

Data entry

- Maintain a folder with a index page linking to individual files for any day where work is done.

Data use

- Regions computational component (macro)

    Parse the work files and develop a list of work done for the region. This is then displayed on the region page.

- landscape-garden/wood-duck-meadows/wood-duck-work-history.md

    Generated by the computational component after reading the work files

- region pages

    Work history table for the given region.



Data

- landscape-garden/wood-duck-meadows/work-files/

    Folder that contains individual markdown files for each day work is done. Files organised into years.

- landscape-garden/wood-duck-meadows/work-files/<yyyy>/<filename>.md

    Individual markdown file for work on a day/time period. Frontmatter will contain a collection of specific information (date/time period, region, ???). Content is the description 


| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Date | Date of the work done a date field or range |
| Region | Name of the region(s) where the work was done. |

Code

- Class `workHistory` to read all the work history data

    Provide an iterator to iterate in various ways through the work history data. Utility class for other code.

- macro `regionWorkHistory`

    Passed the name of a region, generate the table work history to add to the region page.

- macro `woodDuckWorkHistory`

    Generate the work history page for Wood duck meadows.
