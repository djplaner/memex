The final step of [[convert-wordpress-into-memex | converting my Wordpress blog]] to markdown files is updating the interface of the markdown blog.

To do

- Overall design
    - get light/dark mode working
    - set dark mode as default
- 


## Blog interface design

### Resources

- [Material for Mkdocs blog templates](https://andre601.ch/blog/2025/02-10-integrate-gitea-forgejo-stats/) and [here in the repo](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/blob/master/material/templates/blog-post.html)


## Overall design

### Interface components

#### Header

Components

- Site icon - probably won't use one
- search area
- light/dark mode toggle
- top level navigation menu
- hero - used on old post pages
- **todo** adding the prev/next to the header on blog posts

Consider adopting a more cloud based design

- [cloud CSS shape](https://css-shape.com/cloud/)

#### Footer

Components

- Previous/next menu -- **possible remove**
- Made with Material & social links
    - **TODO** modify the "made with" to link to a specific page providing more details about all the technologies used to create the blog (material for mkdocs and so much more)

#### Navigation list (list of archives)

Components

- heading
- list - need to make these look more like links

**TODO** 

- turn off the navigation that has Home and About appearing in the left hand menu

#### Home page

Components

- archive list
     - **TODO** make it links look like links
- **todo** reinstate the left hand colum (empty)
- list of blog posts
    - **todo** figure out a better way to visually separate different posts


#### Post page

Components

- headings within the post
- Table of contents - **todo** make this look like archive list 
- headings for the comments/pingbacks sections
- comments
- pingbacks


#### Category/archives page

- category header
- **Todo** add a next/prev like archives
- **todo** add a list of catgegories to the left hand column
- footer

### Header
`
                              <title> - David's weblog

   Home About RSS                                            light/dark Search
`

### Typology

Can use any [Google font](https://fonts.google.com/) - set in `mkdocs.yml`. Currently using Gabarito.

### Colour schemes

Having difficulties getting custom colour schemes to work.

Linear background - dark blue with Blackish clouds at the top. 

Dark
```css
background: #100775;
background: linear-gradient(280deg, rgba(16, 7, 117, 1) 0%, rgba(10, 5, 79, 1) 50%, rgba(4, 10, 46, 1) 100%);
```

light
```css
background: #f8f7fa;
background: linear-gradient(280deg, rgba(248, 247, 250, 1) 0%, rgba(225, 225, 237, 1) 50%, rgba(195, 199, 217, 1) 100%);
```
