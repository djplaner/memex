Early experiments with extracting information (about plants) from photos.

## Purpose

Work on [[wood-duck-meadows]] will include a fair bit of planting. For some of these plants we'll want to track and manage their life cycle. This will include taking photos over time. The number and type of individual plants will be large making manual tracking insufficient. Linking photos to a specific plant and broader information about the individual and type of plant will be key.

Initial aims include:

1. Extract information (including GPS location) of plants from photos;
2. Store that information in markdown/yaml frontmatter associated with individual plants; and,
3. Use that information in a number of other [[computational-components]].

    Examples to include:

    - Macros that help with maintaining information about individual plants, plant species, and zones.
    - Generating map-based representations of [[wood-duck-meadows]] indicating individual plant locations and providing subsequent access to plant information.

## Considerations

### Sharing geolocation data

Currently, the photos shared via memex are stripped of geolocation data. This makes the task here a bit more complicated. Suggesting a need for another private source of photos with geolocation data.

## Development/exploration

### Python photo modules

Various older, specific modules for reading exif image data, but [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) appears to be the best supported.

[Tutorial on reading exif using Pillow](https://thepythoncode.com/article/extracting-image-metadata-in-python)

Reading exif and other associated data via PIL is harder and less well documented than I would've expected.

### Map generation

The [folium module](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/latest/) provide Python access to the [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) library. 

### Accessing OS X Photos app

Photos are currently stored in the Photos app. The [osxphotos module](https://github.com/RhetTbull/osxphotos?tab=readme-ov-file) seems to provide an answer.
