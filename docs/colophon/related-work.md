Much of the work on this site aims to adopt thoughts from the following related work.

## Related work

Decades later and there are systems (e.g. Obsidian and Notion) and concepts like [personal knowledge management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management) which echo this vision. This is my attempt to build my own Memex using [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/) and over time move beyond that.

- [Raw dog the open web](https://www.fromjason.xyz/p/notebook/raw-dog-the-open-web/)
    
    [Jason Velazquez](https://buymeacoffee.com/fromjason) discusses an alternative to the big-tech monoculture where corporate algorithms control what we see online. That alternative being as simple as exploring the open web beyond the algorithm and publicly curating a collection of links. Taking "off the latex wrapped around our digital spaces"
- [Patterns for Personal websites](http://www.rdrop.com/~half/Creations/Writings/Web.patterns/index.html)

    One of the links shared by Jason. Provides a collection of patterns for personal websites grouped by" content, structure, time, navigation, and technology.

- [Smallest Federated Wiki as an alternate version of the web](https://hapgood.us/2014/06/04/smallest-federated-wiki-as-an-alternate-vision-of-the-web/)

    Mike Caufield delves into the how the Smallest Federated Wiki (SFW) - aka [Federated Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_Wiki) - offers to improve the basic web into something a little more informed by insights from Ted Nelson and beyond.

- [Wiki Principles](https://wiki.c2.com/?WikiPrinciples) originally developed by Ward Cunningham
    - Easy text entry
    - Automatic link generation 
    - Content editable by all
    - Recent changes
    - Search a page by title and/or contents
    - Quick diff
    - Page list (list all pages on the wiki)
    - Backlinks (findn all pages pointing to a page)

### Other examples

Random examples of what others have achieved using Foam combine with other technologies

- [Foam-document](https://jackiexiao.github.io/foam/) - Foam site supporting to the foam/mkdocs template
- [DevBook](https://devbook.baum.software/) - using [Just the Docs](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs) - Jekyll
- [Paul's Digital Garden](https://garden.paulderaaij.nl/) - uses the [PARA method](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/) and a Gatsby theme
- [lzrd.dev](https://lzrd.dev/) - 11ty with foam, pages include backlinks
- [A working library](https://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/make-life-possible) - used quite a bit, more traditional "book" style design - good functionality
