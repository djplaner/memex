Implements methods to visualise the most recent changes made to the site (via its git repository) using differing methods, including:

1. [x] [Table of _x_ most recent changes](#table-of-recent-changes)
2. [ ] A timeline of changes.
3. [ ] Other representations

## Table of recent changes

A macro "function" `recentChanges` that takes the number of recent changes to display as a parameter. For example, using the macro `recentChanges(10)` appropriately will display a table of the 10 most recent changes in the published page.

Implemented using the [`mkdocs-macros-plugin`](https://mkdocs-macros-plugin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for MkDocs.

As used on the [Memex home page](../index.md).

### How

Include the macro anywhere in a Markdown file using the standard [`mkdocs-macros-plugin`](https://mkdocs-macros-plugin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) syntax. For example, the following (which is used on [the memex home page](../index.md))

```markdown
{{ '{{ recentChanges(5) }}' }}
```

Will produce the following table when the macro is expanded by the [[computational-components]] as the site is published.

{{ recentChanges(5) }}

### Implementation

Uses the Python [`GitPython`](https://gitpython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library to query git repo for most recent commits. Converts that data structure into a markdown table. See the [macros.py source file](https://github.com/djplaner/memex/blob/master/util/macros.py) for the implementation.

## Timeline of changes

!!! warning "ðŸš§ Under construction "

    This is work in progress.

### Possible timeline tools

!!! info "CSS is a problem, try MkDocs plugin"

    CSS timelines from Codepen were a hassle to get working with the Material for MkDocs interface. Try MkDocs specific timeline?
