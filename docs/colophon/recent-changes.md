Implements methods to visualise the most recent changes made to the site (via its git repository) using differing methods, including:

1. [x] [Table of _x_ most recent changes](#table-of-recent-changes)
2. [x] [A timeline of changes](#timeline-of-changes)
3. [ ] Other representations - _not started yet_

## Table of recent changes

A macro "function" `recentChanges` that takes the number of recent changes to display as a parameter. For example, using the macro `recentChanges(10)` appropriately will display a table of the 10 most recent changes in the published page.

Implemented using the [`mkdocs-macros-plugin`](https://mkdocs-macros-plugin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for MkDocs.

As used on the [Memex home page](../index.md).

### How

Include the macro anywhere in a Markdown file using the standard [`mkdocs-macros-plugin`](https://mkdocs-macros-plugin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) syntax. For example, the following (which is used on [the memex home page](../index.md))

```markdown
{{ '{{ recentChanges(5) }}' }}
```

Will produce the following table when the macro is expanded by the [[computational-components]] as the site is published.

{{ recentChanges(5) }}

### Implementation

Uses the Python [`GitPython`](https://gitpython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library to query git repo for most recent commits. Converts that data structure into a markdown table. See the [macros.py source file](https://github.com/djplaner/memex/blob/master/util/macros.py) for the implementation.

## Timeline of changes

Intent is to provide a reverse timeline of changes made to the site.

Originally the thought was to make use of an existing tool. Be it online, pure CSS, or a MkDocs plugin. However, all had limitations/issues. 

Decided instead to implement a basic _MkDocs_/Markdown timeline using headings and MkDocs in-built navigation interface.

See [[timeline-of-changes]] for a working version.

### Markdown timeline

Use Markdown headings to show years (h2) and months (h3) with the appropriate changes listed for each month. Include # of commits per month and year in the headings. Ended up also using Material for MkDocs's grids facility.

Used in [[timeline-of-changes]] to show all changes, but the macro can be used anywhere and will accept the number of changes to show as a parameter. e.g. the following Markdown

```markdown
{{ '{{ recentChangesTimeline(20) }}' }}
```

generates the following

{{ recentChangesTimeline(20)}}

### Possible timeline tools

- [Markwhen](https://markwhen.com/) - a timeline tool that can be used to create timelines from Markdown files.

    Not exactly what I want, not the least because it doesn't connect with git commits....many more reasons.
- [vis-timeline](https://github.com/visjs/vis-timeline)

    More gant chart-like horizontal timeline.
- [Timepasses](https://www.timepasses.net/)

    More an interactive tool for creating timelines.
