# Deploy with github action

The new Mac is a bit dodgy with large commits/pushes to GitHub. Which is a part of the standard deploy process with [[why-mkdocs-foam]]. 


## First attempt
One solution is to [deploy mkdocs with a GitHub action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-mkdocs). 

Requirements 

1. [X] Enable GitHub pages 
2. [X] Building with `[PERSONAL|GITHUB]_TOKEN? (using GITHUB)
3. [ ] Which mkdocs plugins
   - Generate requirements file  

Working? - no `No event triggers define in "on"`

Out of date.

## Second attempt - use the Material for [mkdocs approach](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/publishing-your-site/)


First attempt fails 
> Deploy - Process completed with exits code 1.

Double check gh-pages as publish branch - this probably won't make any difference
