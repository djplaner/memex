## Analytics

### Exploring [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com) (installed)

- [x] Installed on blog with CSP
- [x] Installed on Memex without CSP

A Google analytics alternative with a [good design rationale](https://www.goatcounter.com/why) with a focus on privacy.

Requires a sign-up for a specific domain and provides a JS script that gets added to the site, and a URL to access the stats.

It's not without its issues. XSS, CSP, and ad blockers can limit the stats gathered. But [[all-models-are-wrong]] and I can live with this _wrongness_.

Main solution I used was to add CSP policy via `meta` tag in templates.

Adding this to Memex has issues as Material for MkDocs implementation of glightbox relies on inline Javascript.

## Statistics

Methods for generating statistics about information on the site. Expanding on the statistics being generated on the blog Foam site.

### Current practice

[[blog-statistics]] is implemented as a combination of a generator that writes a YAML file which is subsequently read by a macro to generate a HTML table.

Has the possible drawback of causing the `mkdocs` server to continually rebuild after initial setup. But for the blog other things do it too.
