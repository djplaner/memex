### Exploring [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com)

A Google analytics alternative with a [good design rationale](https://www.goatcounter.com/why) with a focus on privacy.

Requires a sign-up for a specific domain and provides a JS script that gets added to the site, and a URL to access the stats.

It's not without its issues. XSS, CSP, and ad blockers can limit the stats gathered. But [[all-models-are-wrong]] and I can live with this _wrongness_.

Main solution I used was to add CSP policy via `meta` tag in templates.

Adding this to Memex has issues as Material for MkDocs implementation of glightbox relies on inline Javascript.
