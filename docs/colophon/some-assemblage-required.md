!!! note "ðŸš§  Work in progress ðŸš§"

    Still figuring out the shape and content of this page.

Intent being to explain that "memex" is more than a website. A collection of files (HTML and images) accessed via a web browser. That listing the technology behind the site is insufficient to explain what goes into the site.

Drawing on ideas like

- [[assemblage|Assemblage "theory"]]
- [[bricolage]] and [[bad-mindset]], [[casa]], and [[gather-weave]]
- [[digital-weaver]] and [[digital-renovator]]
- [[orchestration]] especially as used in [[drons-technology|Dron's definition of technology]]
- The [[nodt|nature of digital technology]]
