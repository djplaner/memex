Implemented as a [[computational-components]]. Two step process

1. `mkdocs-gen-files` generates a YAML file written to document root.

    Draws on data structures that are already generated to implement blog functionality. 
2. `mkdocs-macros-plugin` reads the YAML file and generates a HTML table in response to a macro included in any page.

### Future statistics

- [x] posts and words per year
- top external links
- top internal links

Calculate the stats and write to the YAML file

```yaml
posts_per_year:
  2020: 10
  2021: 15
  2022: 20
words_per_year:
    2020: 5000
    2021: 7500
    2022: 10000 
```

### Parameters

Can `mkdocs-macros-plugin` be given parameters to control which statistics are generated?

It does provide [variables](https://mkdocs-macros-plugin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#variables). Implemented as environment variables that can be used within functions. Variables are defined globally or locally. Locally in YAML headers or using Jinja templates.

```jinja2
{%set my_variable = "value" %}
```
