Current practice means that each bubble (note) should specify a `type` in its front-matter metadata. Not a huge leap for `type` to be used to think about each bubble as an object of a particular "class". Without actually currently having a formal Python class for each bubble type.

## Bubble design

A markdown file typically contains

- front-matter metadata - in YAML format;
    - `type` - defining the bubble type
    - `aka` - list of other related types/bubbles.

        Points to other types to which the object is also an example of. e.g. the observation of a plant would be `type: observation` but it may also be `aka-types: [ plant, single-plant, garys-ficus ]` i.e. an observation of both a species of plant and an individual plant. The list might also include the wikiLink for a specific bubble for that individual plant `garys-ficus`
    - other fields used as per needs for the specific bubble type
- content - in markdown format.

`corpus.py` creates Python dicts from a Markdown file with the following structure

```python
      {
        "content": "content of file",
        "yaml": { _all yaml defined variables_ },
        "filePath": "/path/to/file.md"
        "linkDefs": { 
           ...
        }
        ...
      }
```




## Bubble types

### In use bubble types

| Bubble type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `note` | General note about some topic  |
| `index` | Landing page for a collection of related notes |
| `work-history` | Object definition for [[wood-duck-work-history]] component |
| `recipe` | Recipes used regularly - see [[recipes]] |
| `zone` | Defines one of the [[wood-duck-meadows]] zone |
| `computational-component` | A computational component - see [[computational-components]] |
| `colophon` | Notes about the site itself - see [[colophon]] |
| `quote` | A quote from some source - see [[quotes]] |
| `post` | A blog post |
| `plant` | Details about a species of plant found at [[wood-duck-meadows]] |
| `single-plant` | Details about an individual plant found at [[wood-duck-meadows]] |
| `graph-visualisation` | Bubble defining a graph visualisation - see [[graph|Bubble network visualisation]] |
| `mathContent` | A bubble containing mathematical content from my short stint as a wannabe mathematics teacher |

### Possible new bubble types

| Bubble type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `observation` | For use with [[wood-duck-observations]] component - to record observations of animals, birds, insects, etc |

### All current bubble types

Following list generated by a [[computational-components]] (macro) and shows all of the current bubble types. The large number of `unknown` types illustrating that this wasn't a practice from the start.
