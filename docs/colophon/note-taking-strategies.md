Exploring and reflecting on various note-taking strategies and if/how they are applied on this site.

## Broader Strategies

- [[zettelkasten]] - a method for note-taking and knowledge management
- [[digital-garden]]


### Process strategies

"End of day ritual" (@jevakallio) - at the end of day check all daily notes from various media and consolidate into Foam.

## Note taking strategies 

### [Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5E5QawiXCMbtNtupvxeoEX)

From Andy Matuschak, rather than take transient notes, evergreen notes "are written and organised to evolve, contribute, and accumulate over time, across projects"

Principles

- Evergreen notes should be atomic
- Evergreen notes should be concept-oriented
- Evergreen notes should be densely linked
- Prefer associative ontologies to hierarchical taxonomies
- Write notes for yourself, by default, disregarding audience

### Content structure for individual notes

[Content structure](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/#content-structure)

- Title with option description to describe topic
- My thoughts on the topic
- Sub-topics - various related sub-topics
- Notes - personal notes on the topics, things considered interesting etc.
- Code - code snippets
- Links

### [Applications are designed for authoring not thinking](https://notes.azlen.me/g3tibyfv/)

Suggests characteristics of a tool for thought

- Are flexible in their use
- Enable different workflows 
- Give the user agency 
- Blur the lines between users, designers, and programmers 
- Are not always intuitive 

## Examples

- [Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes)
- [Gwern Branwen](https://gwern.net)
- [Azlen Elza](https://notes.azlen.me/g3tibyfv/) informed by Andy Matuschak's work
- [lzy-code](https://github.com/lyz-code/blue-book) - uses MkDocs

    - Hard coded nav, multiple levels

- [Tom Critchlow](https://tomcritchlow.com)

    - Nice layout
    - uses [Commento](https://commento.io)
    - not obviously a garden
