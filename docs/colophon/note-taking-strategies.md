Exploring and reflecting on various note-taking strategies and if/how they are applied on this site.

## Strategies

> Everybody wants to play in the Stream, but no one wants to build the Garden. ([Caulfield, 2015](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/))

### [Applications are designed for authoring not thinking](https://notes.azlen.me/g3tibyfv/)

Suggests characteristics of a tool for thought

- Are flexible in their use
- Enable different workflows 
- Give the user agency 
- Blur the lines between users, designers, and programmers 
- Are not always intuitive 

### Gardens are...

[Non-technical gardening](https://maggieappleton.com/nontechnical-gardening) argues that digital gardens are:

- **Explorable** - deeply inter-linked that can be navigated freely, rather than structured and linear.
- **Slowly grown over time** - never done, always being revised

### Content structure

[Content structure](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/#content-structure)

- Title with option description to describe topic
- My thoughts on the topic
- Sub-topics - various related sub-topics
- Notes - personal notes on the topics, things considered interesting etc.
- Code - code snippets
- Links

### Digital Gardens

Where a garden is located somewhere between a personal blog and a wiki. A collection of notes/essays/ideas. Evolutionary, exploratory, and forever incomplete these are linked through contextual associations, rather than organised by publication date.

- [Stock and flow](https://snarkmarket.com/2010/4890/) - 2010 post by Robin Sloan explaining the difference between the concepts of 
  - **Stock** - "is the durable stuff. it's the content you produce that's as interesting in two months (or two years) as it is today..."
  - **Flow** - "is the feed. It's the posts and the tweets. It's the stream of daily and sub-daily updates that reminds people you exist"
