Exploring and reflecting on various note-taking strategies and if/how they are applied on this site.

## Strategies

### Zettelkasten

- [Zettelkasten - It's like GTD for writing and here's why you should consider it](https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-its-like-gtd-for-writing-and-here-s-why-you-should-consider-it-7dddf02be394)

### Digital Gardens

> Everybody wants to play in the Stream, but no one wants to build the Garden. ([Caulfield, 2015](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/))

Where a garden is located somewhere between a personal blog and a wiki. A collection of notes/essays/ideas. Evolutionary, exploratory, and forever incomplete these are linked through contextual associations, rather than organised by publication date.

- [Stock and flow](https://snarkmarket.com/2010/4890/) - 2010 post by Robin Sloan explaining the difference between the concepts of 
  - **Stock** - "is the durable stuff. it's the content you produce that's as interesting in two months (or two years) as it is today..."
  - **Flow** - "is the feed. It's the posts and the tweets. It's the stream of daily and sub-daily updates that reminds people you exist"
- [Mike Caulfield's dLRN 2015 presentation originating the idea of a Digital Garden](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/)
- [Digital gardeners github repo](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners)

    - Includes a collection of links: [How-to's and tutorials](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners?tab=readme-ov-file#how-tos-and-tutorials) and [theory, philosophy and navel-gazing](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners?tab=readme-ov-file#theory-philosophy-and-navel-gazing)

- [Digital garden as a static website](https://stereobooster.com/posts/digital-garden-as-static-website/) - Detailed article looking at features of a digital garden, including publishing. See also - [astro digital garden](https://astro-digital-garden.stereobooster.com)

### Process strategies

"End of day ritual" (@jevakallio) - at the end of day check all daily notes from various media and consolidate into Foam.

#### Gardens are...

[Non-technical gardening](https://maggieappleton.com/nontechnical-gardening) argues that digital gardens are:

- **Explorable** - deeply inter-linked that can be navigated freely, rather than structured and linear.
- **Slowly grown over time** - never done, always being revised

## Note taking strategies 

### [Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5E5QawiXCMbtNtupvxeoEX)

From Andy Matuschak, rather than take transient notes, evergreen notes "are written and organised to evolve, contribute, and accumulate over time, across projects"

Principles

- Evergreen notes should be atomic
- Evergreen notes should be concept-oriented
- Evergreen notes should be densely linked
- Prefer associative ontologies to hierarchical taxonomies
- Write notes for yourself, by default, disregarding audience



### Content structure for individual notes

[Content structure](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/#content-structure)

- Title with option description to describe topic
- My thoughts on the topic
- Sub-topics - various related sub-topics
- Notes - personal notes on the topics, things considered interesting etc.
- Code - code snippets
- Links

## Technology/tool design

Related tools

- [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so) - a VSCode extension for note-taking and knowledge management
    - See [getting started](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/678c77d9-ef2c-4537-97b5-64556d6337f1/)
    - Uses hierarchies

### Feature to check out

Roam

- Folds and focus

Obsidian

- Note in note insert
    `!\[Remnote\]` has the note inserted into the current note.

Silver bullet

- [Objects](https://silverbullet.md/Objects)

    Extracts objects from markdown files. Maintains an index of these objects and allows use of a query language and some CSS to do "stuff". Objects have attributes. Some pre-defined. Part of [Silver bullet's focus](https://silverbullet.md/End-User%20Programming) on [[end-user-programming]]

    - Query language 
    - Template language
    - Command links
    - Anchor support 
    - Space Script
    - Schemas
    - Space Config
    - Attribute extractors
    - Object decorators
    - Unfurl functionality
    - Live embeds
    - Federation
    - Markdown widgets (plug feature)
    - Cron hook (plug feature)
    - Widget hooks (plug feature)

[Logseq](https://docs.logseq.com/#/page/start%20here) - Desktop app

- [queries](https://docs.logseq.com/#/page/queries) and [advanced queries](https://docs.logseq.com/#/page/advanced%20queries)


### [Applications are designed for authoring not thinking](https://notes.azlen.me/g3tibyfv/)

Suggests characteristics of a tool for thought

- Are flexible in their use
- Enable different workflows 
- Give the user agency 
- Blur the lines between users, designers, and programmers 
- Are not always intuitive 




## Examples

- [Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes)
- [Gwern Branwen](https://gwern.net)
- [Azlen Elza](https://notes.azlen.me/g3tibyfv/) informed by Andy Matuschak's work
- [lzy-code](https://github.com/lyz-code/blue-book) - uses MkDocs

    - Hard coded nav, multiple levels

- [Tom Critchlow](https://tomcritchlow.com)

    - Nice layout
    - uses [Commento](https://commento.io)
    - not obviously a garden
