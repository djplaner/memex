Exploring and reflecting on various note-taking strategies and if/how they are applied on this site.

## Critiques

[I deleted my second brain](https://www.joanwestenberg.com/p/i-deleted-my-second-brain) provides some pushback on the benefits of this type of approach. 10,000 notes removed because of how the focus on a "second brain" "froze my curiosity into static categories" and other limitations.

## Broader Strategies

- [[zettelkasten]] - a method for note-taking and knowledge management
- [[digital-garden]]



### Process strategies

"End of day ritual" (@jevakallio) - at the end of day check all daily notes from various media and consolidate into Foam.

## Note taking strategies 

### [Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5E5QawiXCMbtNtupvxeoEX)

From Andy Matuschak, rather than take transient notes, evergreen notes "are written and organised to evolve, contribute, and accumulate over time, across projects"

Principles

- Evergreen notes should be atomic
- Evergreen notes should be concept-oriented
- Evergreen notes should be densely linked
- Prefer associative ontologies to hierarchical taxonomies
- Write notes for yourself, by default, disregarding audience

### CODE - Capture, Organise, Distill, and Express

Forte's [second brain](https://fortelabs.com/blog/basboverview/) four step method

1. Capture - collect info you think worth saving

    Three guidelines suggested

    1. Think like a curator - don't consume immediately, set aside a time for that
    2. Keep only what resonates - don't be overly intellectual
    3. Use capture tools - to gain info in digital form

2. Organise for actionability -  Simple and more flexible organisation, focus on active projects

    Three guidelines 

    1. Adopt the para method - Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives
    2. Start with a clean state
    3. Ask three questions - filter info by asking "what (project/area/resource) will this be useful?" - Done once a week

3. Distill down to the essence - into 

    Another 3 guidlines

    1. Design notes for your future self - define key terms, insert placeholders, add links to related websites, files etc.
    2. Summarise progressively at different levels of detail
    3. Distill opportunistically, a little at a time


### Content structure for individual notes

[Content structure](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/#content-structure)

- Title with option description to describe topic
- My thoughts on the topic
- Sub-topics - various related sub-topics
- Notes - personal notes on the topics, things considered interesting etc.
- Code - code snippets
- Links

## Technology/tool design

Related tools

- [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so) - a VSCode extension for note-taking and knowledge management
    - See [getting started](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/678c77d9-ef2c-4537-97b5-64556d6337f1/)
    - Uses hierarchies

### Feature to check out

Roam

- Folds and focus

Obsidian

- Note in note insert
    `!\[Remnote\]` has the note inserted into the current note.

Silver bullet

- [Objects](https://silverbullet.md/Objects)

    Extracts objects from markdown files. Maintains an index of these objects and allows use of a query language and some CSS to do "stuff". Objects have attributes. Some pre-defined. Part of [Silver bullet's focus](https://silverbullet.md/End-User%20Programming) on [[end-user-programming]]

    - Query language 
    - Template language
    - Command links
    - Anchor support 
    - Space Script
    - Schemas
    - Space Config
    - Attribute extractors
    - Object decorators
    - Unfurl functionality
    - Live embeds
    - Federation
    - Markdown widgets (plug feature)
    - Cron hook (plug feature)
    - Widget hooks (plug feature)

### [Applications are designed for authoring not thinking](https://notes.azlen.me/g3tibyfv/)

Suggests characteristics of a tool for thought

- Are flexible in their use
- Enable different workflows 
- Give the user agency 
- Blur the lines between users, designers, and programmers 
- Are not always intuitive 

## Examples

- [Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes)
- [Gwern Branwen](https://gwern.net)
- [Azlen Elza](https://notes.azlen.me/g3tibyfv/) informed by Andy Matuschak's work
- [lzy-code](https://github.com/lyz-code/blue-book) - uses MkDocs

    - Hard coded nav, multiple levels

- [Tom Critchlow](https://tomcritchlow.com)

    - Nice layout
    - uses [Commento](https://commento.io)
    - not obviously a garden

## Resources

[Learning Library](https://www.notion.so/moritz42w/Learning-Library-2ecb646b5e1e4d5c8274c73c3fbb2541) - large colelction of references related to note-taking and much more
