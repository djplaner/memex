title: Three great virtues of a programmer
type: note
---
[Initial description](https://wiki.c2.com/?LazinessImpatienceHubris) with glossary taken from _Programming Perl_

An important point to make is that Wall offers very specific, positive definitions for these apparently less than positive terms. Definitions that suggest a better type of programmer. Something we (certainly I) tend to fall short of. There are some (e.g. [this](https://hackernoon.com/larry-walls-three-virtues-of-a-programmer-are-utter-bullshit-fykp32ck)) which argue aginst the virtues, but only because they ascribe their own definitions. [This](https://betterprogramming.pub/here-are-the-three-virtues-of-good-programmers-e561e061ea19) makes the point.

Someone [offered](https://wiki.c2.com/?LazinessImpatienceHubris) this modification

>  Be lazy in an industrious way 
>  Be impatient in a very patient way 
>  Be proud in a very humble way

Definitions taken from _Programming Perl_

> ## Laziness
>
> The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people will find useful, and document what you wrote so you don't have to answer so many questions about it. Hence, the first great virtue of a programmer. Also hence, this book. See also impatience and hubris. (p.609)
>
> ## Impatience
>
> The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This makes you write programs that don't just react to your needs, but actually anticipate them. Or at least pretend to. Hence, the second great virtue of a programmer. See also laziness and hubris. (p.608)
>
> ## Hubris
> 
> Excessive pride, the sort of thing Zeus zaps you for. Also the quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that other people won't want to say bad things about. Hence, the third great virtue of a programmer. See also laziness and impatience. (p.607)

> It's telling that computer science is the only field where "lazy" is a technical term.
