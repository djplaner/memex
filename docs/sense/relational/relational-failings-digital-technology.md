## As workplace learning

Ramsten & Saljo (2012)
> Core elements of this social and anthropological turns in the study of learning are ideas of the situated and distributed nature of human knowing (Lave, 1988), the central role of communities and master–apprenticeship (or expert–novice) relationships for understanding trajectories of learning, and the significance of identity and identity transformations for moving from the periphery of a community to becoming a fully recognized practitioner. In terms of research strategies, this development implies that the study of learning largely “becomes an ethnographic project” (Lave, 1997, p. 150) in which familiarity with the embeddedness of human actions and skills in enduring and tool-saturated practices are a sine qua non for the analysis of knowing and learning
