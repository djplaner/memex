# Relational Agency

Edwards (2011) offers this definition of _relational agency_
> relational agency involves a capacity for working with others to strengthen purposeful responses to complex problems. It arises in a two stage process within a constant dynamic which consists of:
> (i) working with others to expand the ‘object of activity’ or task being worked on by recognising the motives and the resources that others bring to bear as they, too, interpret it; and
> (ii) aligning one’s own responses to the newly enhanced interpretations with the responses being made by the other professionals while acting on the expanded object.
