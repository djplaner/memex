title: Narrated Powerpoint transcripts
---
## Problem

A course that has narrated powerpoints. How can we quickly generate transcripts from the existing powerpoints.

1. Convert audio recording into transcript
2. Display transcript within web page while playing narrated powerpoint
3. provide transcript as separate text

## Summary

Tentative
- Can't add transcripts to narrated powerpoint - because it's not video.
- VTT and similar work with video.
- Suggesting a need to publish to Stream and then work on the transcript from there

## Resource exploration

- [Create accessible narrated powerpoint for content delivery online](https://topr.online.ucf.edu/create-accessible-narrated-powerpoint-for-content-delivery-online/)
  - Design oriented. Explaining why, recommends creating transcript first, a couple of references

### Microsoft

- [Add closed captions or subtitles to media in PowerPoint](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-closed-captions-or-subtitles-to-media-in-powerpoint-df091537-fb22-4507-898f-2358ddc0df18)
  - Adding transcripts to videos in the presentation. NOT of the presentation
- [Present with real-time, automatic captions or subtitles in PowerPoint](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/present-with-real-time-automatic-captions-or-subtitles-in-powerpoint-68d20e49-aec3-456a-939d-34a79e8ddd5f?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us)
  - Microsoft docs. How to. Live captions, not transcript


## Experiments

PowerPoint application unable to share embed.  Powerpoint online can.

It does seem to auto play, once revealed.

### Publish to Stream

PowerPoint application includes option (File/Save As) to publish to Stream
Takes a real long time to do it.
