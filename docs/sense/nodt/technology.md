## Invented after you were born

[This post](https://kk.org/thetechnium/everything-that/) offer's Alan Kay's apparent definitions
> "Technology," Kay says, "is anything that was invented after you were born."

## Everything that doesn't work yet

Same post has Danny Hills (who worked with Alan Kay) refined it a touch
> "Technology," Hills says, "is everything that doesn't work yet"

Which links nicely to Postman's 5th idea that [technology becomes mythic](../../share/Five-things-we-need-to-know-about-technological-change.md#fifth-idea-technology-tends-to-become-mythic)

## What you get for free

[Ryan North](https://longnow.org/ideas/how-invent-everything/)

> I'd love to play with the idea of what definitions of Technology are yeah it boiled down to me this I think I said in the talk **something you don't get for free** .... so if you in a human body don't show up in the world with it then I would call that technology it's something that humans are making for themselves to make the world easier change it in some way and that's a very broad view of technology

## It depends - 

Then Douglas Adams evolves it to

> 1) everything that’s already in the world when you’re born is just normal;
> 2) anything that gets invented between then and before you turn thirty is incredibly exciting and creative and with any luck you can make a career out of it;
> 3) anything that gets invented after you’re thirty is against the natural order of things and the beginning of the end of civilisation as we know it until it’s been around for about ten years when it gradually turns out to be alright really.
