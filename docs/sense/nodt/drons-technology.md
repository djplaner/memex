# Dron's take on technology

- Orchestration of phenomena to some use - Technology: organising stuff to do stuff 
- Technologies evolve by assembly - The stuff we orgnaise to do stuff usually includes staff that has been organised to do stuff
- Counter technologies - many/most technologies in an assembly are needed to fix problems caused by _other_ technologies in the assembly
- _Soft technologies_ are made to have gaps inventively filled
- _Hard technologies_ force us to fill the gaps correctly, as cogs in the machine

    However, any technologies can be assembled with others in new and unpretesteable ways

- Not just users but participants - technologies are partly (sometimes wholly) made of us
- Technique the stuff we do with stuff that is done - technologies are enacted by humans

- The adjacent possible - there are always gaps to fill. New tech makes new adjacent possible empty niches

- _Pace layering_ - larger and slower changing technologies have more influence than smaller and faster changing technologies. There are hierarchical layers.
- _Path dependencies_ - What exists constrains invention

- Hard technologies create the context/environment for software technologies - What is rigid constrains what is flexible


- _Syndecdoches and wholes_ What matters is the _whole_ assembly. The parts may be essential, but they are not the technologies of interest.


## Suggestions

- Build with small robust, assemblable components
- Be the orchestration, not the orchestrated
- Use open standards, or wrap closed systems in open wrappers
- Rent generic replaceable services, not monoliths
