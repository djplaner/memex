In a [2016 presentation](https://djon.es/blog/2016/05/30/digital-technology-ignorance-and-its-implications-for-learning-and-teaching/) I wove together ideas about the nature of digital technology from various authors and streams of literature. The intent was not to ignore the socio-cultural aspects of technology in action, but to explore if many of the issues with digital technology (especially in education) arises from an ignorance of the nature of digital technology. Not a good staring point.

Understanding the nature of digital technology is not digital literacy, the ability to code, or understanding how to use a computer (or other digital device). It's an attempt to get at something a little more fundamental and abstract about all digital technology. Not the specifics of a particular piece of software or device.

Similarly, it's not a claim that all digital technology retain the nature of digital technology. Many digital technologies - and increasingly so (see [[enshittification|platform decay (enshittification)]]) - have been actively designed to obscure this nature. 

The techno-optimist in me thinks (perhaps hopes) that if we better understand the nature of digital technology then we can better leverage it for our purposes. 

Many, many questions

- How does this relate to thinking about [[drons-technology|technology in general]]?
- How does this related to more [[distribution|distributive]] ways of thinking (e.g. [[assemblage]] etc.)

Additional thinking for this work was outlined in some blog posts:

- [What is the nature of digital technology?](https://djon.es/blog/2016/06/27/what-is-the-nature-of-digital-technology-part-1/)
- [The nature of digital technology? Part 2](https://djon.es/blog/2016/06/28/the-nature-of-digital-technology-part-2/)
- [Nature of digital technology? Part 2 - expansion](https://djon.es/blog/2016/06/29/nature-of-digital-technology-part-2-expansion/)
- [Organising for innovation in the digitised world](https://djon.es/blog/2016/05/16/organizing-for-innovation-in-the-digitized-world/) - a summary and reflection on Yoo et al (2012)

| Traits of innovations with pervasive digital technology | <ol> <li> Platforms </li> <li> Distributed innovations </li> <li> Combinatorial innovation </li> </ol> | Yoo, et al (2012) |

[^complications]: Koehler and Mishra (2009) are getting at how social and contextual factors complication digital technologies, i.e. these are not properties of digital technology. Hence probably shouldn't be included.

[^organisational]: Like complications these can be seen as social/contextual. However, _affordances_ and _social factors_ are something that impacts any technology. _Convergence_ and _generativity_ arise because of the nature of digital technology. Hence there is a difference suggesting perhaps they should be kept in this model?

## Yoo et al (2012)

Yoo et al (2012) identified two fundamental properties of digital technology 

1. data homgenisation - all data is represented in binary.
2. reprogrammability - algorithms are also represented in binary and those algorithms can be changed.

Do we really understand the nature of digital technology? If there is a lack of understanding, does that contribute to our inability to leverage it for our purposes?

What other properties are fundamental to digital technology? Are these properties always available for all digital technologies? If not, why not? Is this a problem? 

## Origins

Line of thought driven by the idea that digital technology is actually different in its [[affordances]]. That if these differences aren't understood then there are limits on how they can be leveraged for effective and appropriate purposes. Though obviously the nature of digital technology is not the only consideration.

Expanded in some blog posts (e.g. [What is the nature of digital technology](https://djon.es/blog/2016/06/27/what-is-the-nature-of-digital-technology-part-1/) and into a presentation titled [Digital technology ignorance and its implications for learning and teaching](https://djon.es/blog/2016/05/30/digital-technology-ignorance-and-its-implications-for-learning-and-teaching/)
