## Zittrain (2006)

_generative technology_
> a technology's overall capacity to produce unprompted change driven by large, varied and uncoordinated audiences (Zittrain, 2006, p. 1980)

A "technology's capacity for leverage across a range of tasks, adaptability to a range of different tasks, easy of mastery and accessibility" (Bygstad, 2017, p. 183)

Zittrain (2008) identifies five principal factors influencing how generative a system is
1. leverage
2. adaptation
3. ease of mastery
4. accessibility
5. transferability


## Bygstad (2017)

uses generativity as a theoretical lens

### Definition

> In our context we take generativity to mean the outcome of the interaction between knowledgeable people and flexible information technologies (p. 183)

### Origins and other uses

Bygstad traces the term back to Leibniz and common uses in modern sciences - evolutionary biology, cybernetics and linguisitcs "to express the basic idea that the observed complexity of a phenomenon...can be traced back to some basic elemetns and their mechanisms for interaction (Phelan, 2003)" (Bygstad, 2017, p. 183)

References Zittrain's definition and then argues that generativity "is a socio-technical concept, which includes the user and developer communities involved" (p. 183)

Lane (2011) argues that "**the capacity to innovate is determined by its _generative relationships" (Bygstad, 2017, p. 183).  Avital and Te'eni (2009) found that innovation is dependent "on an appropriate combination of generative technology and a generative collective of users and developers" (Bygstad, 2017, p. 183)
