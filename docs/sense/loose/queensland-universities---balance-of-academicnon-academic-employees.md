title: Queensland Universities - balance of academic/non-academic employees
---
> The Queensland Auditor General [reports](https://www.qao.qld.gov.au/sites/all/libraries/pdf.js/web/viewer.html?file=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.qao.qld.gov.au%2Fsites%2Fqao%2Ffiles%2Freports%2Funiversities_and_grammar_schools-2016_results_of_financial_audits_report_18-2016-17.pdf&utm_medium=email&utm_source=sendpress&utm_campaign) the state’s seven universities were financially sustainable in 2016, all able to comfortably cover short-term liabilities.
> On 2015 figures, at 28.3 per cent state system spending was also well up on the 27 per cent national average of expenditure on non-academic employees. James Cook U had the lowest, 25.2 per cent and University of Southern Queensland the highest, 35.6 per cent. The figures for the three major metros were University of Queensland, 26 per cent, Griffith University 29.7 per cent and QUT 30.5 per cent.  “Queensland universities have an opportunity to improve their efficiency of service delivery,” the auditor observes.
