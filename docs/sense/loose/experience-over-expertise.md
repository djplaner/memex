title: Experience over expertise

[danah boyd](https://points.datasociety.net/did-media-literacy-backfire-7418c084d88d#.34uu04izs) argues that the valuing of expertise of (lived) experience is behind some/many of the factors leading to/events happening because of the post-truth world.

I think there's something here in connection with organisations, management, "coal-face" workers, academia and the enterprise university. But the question of how it plays out in a university - full of supposed experts - would be interesting.

In the context of job applications [this post](http://jamesjwu.com/blog/the-difference-between-experience-and-expertise/) defines expertise and experience. With expertise being a superset of experience. i.e. expertise arises from experience.  The questions are

- How much experience certain experts have in certain contexts?
- How much do contextual characteristics lessen the value of expertise?
- What does expertise abstract away from context that is deemed important by practitioners?
- What is lost in that abstraction process? Is it important or not?
