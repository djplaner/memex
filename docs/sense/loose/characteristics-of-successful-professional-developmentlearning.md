title: Characteristics of successful Professional Development/Learning
---

Desimone (2009) argues that there is some consensus around the characteristics of PD (of teachers) that improves outcomes

- content focus - focus on subject matter content and how students learn that content
- active learning
- coherence - how coherent it is with teachers knowledge and belief and broader contextual policies
- duration - research extended over a semester or an intensive
- collective participation
