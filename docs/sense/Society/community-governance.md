A governance toolkit for great communities 

> For everyone to have the opportunity to be involved in a given group and to participate in its activities the structure must be explicit, not implicit. The rules of decision-making must be open and available to everyone, and this can happen only if they are formalized. (Jo Freeman, 'The Tyranny of Structurelessness')
