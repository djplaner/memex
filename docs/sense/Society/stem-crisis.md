> We needed students in science and math. So we “created STEM.”
> Then folks decided that art needed a place in design thinking so we made “STEAM.”
> Then another smart someone decided that all of this work required texts we read so we created “STREAM.”
> Soon a soothsayer will decide STREAM requires civic engagement and citizenship and decide we need Social Studies leading to “STREAMSS”
> We used to call this “School”
> STEM isn’t a class or subject. It is a way of being, thinking, and doing.
> Iterative design in the process of knowledge creation.
> The only STEM crisis is our addiction to alphabet soup
