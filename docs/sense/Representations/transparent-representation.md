# Transparent representation

See also: [[representations]], [[design]] 

Simon (1996) argues that problem representation is an important part of problem solving and design. He identifies the extreme (perhaps not always possible) version of this view as 

> Solving a problem simply means representing it so as to make the solution transparent.

He uses [[number-scrabble]] as an example
