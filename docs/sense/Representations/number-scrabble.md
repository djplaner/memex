[Number Scrabble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_Scrabble) (aka Pick 15, 3 to 15, [15](https://nrich.maths.org/1223)) is a mathematical game used by Herb Simon to demonstrate the importance of representation to design. 

Two players take turns to pick a number from 1 to 9. The first player to pick three numbers that add up to 15 wins.


With the numbers represented as a sequence of scrabble tiles players must exert some effort to win. If the numbers are organised into a magic square the game is isomorphic to tic-tac-toe.
