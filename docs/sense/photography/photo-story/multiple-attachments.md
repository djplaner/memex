Unit 1 in [[photoclass-2026]] introduced the focal length concept and requested a photo story. My [[a-matter-of-perspective|first response]] focused on perspective changes by varying both focal length and distance to subject. The aim here was to vary focal length and maintain distance to subject. Inevitably this would change the size of the subject in the frame and/or change the subject.

The following uses this to reveal multiple attachments. First, that of some form of small brown paper wasps to their nest.  Next, is the nest to a young [[ficus-obliqua|small-leaf fig tree]] . Lastly, is the attachment of the fig tree to the [[bunker|building]] it has decided to use as its host.

## What would I do differently?

1. Slow down and think it through.

    A variation on the first lesson from the [[a-matter-of-perspective]] story. The "theme" for this story emerged after the photos were taken. The descriptions I've given above are perhaps a bit of a stretch for the resulting images. 
    
    Hence the composition of the images could be improved. With enough forethought I might have been able to add another image that illustrated the attachment of the [[bunker]] to its context.

    Not to mention you can see the shadow of my hat in the last image.
