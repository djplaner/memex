Initial photo story from the [[photoclass-2026]], in particular the unit introducing focal length ([[photoclass-introduction-and-the-gear]]).

The underlying aim was to demonstrate that changes in focal length and distance to subject will impact perspective in an image.

The subject for this test was the [[bunker]]. A derelict, cube-like concrete building on our property. Being cube-like would hopefully emphasise the changes in perspective. Especially by focusing on one corner of the [[bunker]].

I took 7 or 8 photos each using different focal lengths. However, to keep the apparent size of the [[bunker]] consistent I varied my distance from the bunker. From those I selected four that best illustrate the differences with focal lengths of 14mm, 29mm, 39mm, and 58mm.

## What would I do differently?

1. Slow down and pay attention.
   Pay more attention to the size and placement of the subject in the frame. I was too rushed taking these photos. 
   
   Whilst writing this CoPilot on VsCode was suggesting "use a tripod" as part of this point. I'm not quite that into photography, which perhaps says something about my approach.

2. Improve my conceptual understanding
    I understand that changing focal length and distance to subject will impact perspective. But I don't yet fully understand how and why this happens. Need to learn more.


!!! note "What I learned - it's the relative distance"

    Later I started reading and developed the [[focal-length]] note. From that work my explanation for the changes in the images above follows.

    The distance between the front corner of the [[bunker]] and the other two corners is fixed. Let's say _1_ and _2_ metres. 

    In the first image, I'm perhaps 5 metres away from the front corner and _6_ and _7_ metres away from the other two corners.

    In the last image, I'm perhaps 30 metres away from the front corner and _31_ and _32_ metres away from the other two corners.

    In the first image the relative distance between the corners is larger. 1/6 = 0.167 and 2/7 = 0.286. Than in the second image where the relative distances are smaller. 1/31 = 0.032 and 2/32 = 0.063.

    Yes, I know that's probably not the correct mathematics but it provides a concrete way for me to understand.
