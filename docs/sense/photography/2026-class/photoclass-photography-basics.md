## Exposure

**Exposure**

- amount of light that reaches the camera's sensor
- how the sensor processes that light to create an image
- a pretty fundamental aspect of photography

Under and over exposure - too little or too much light reaching the sensor.

Well-exposed image has a balanced range of tones from dark to light, with details preserved in both shadows and highlights.

### How a camera measures light

Modern cameras have built-in light meters that suggest what the camera considers a 'correct' exposure - usually involves judging what the subject is and making its luminosity towards 18% gray.

What's next depends on the mode

-   **Auto mode:** The camera chooses all settings.

-  **Semi-automatic modes (Aperture or Shutter Priority):** You control one setting while the camera adjusts the others.

-   **Manual mode:** You set everything yourself, using the light meter as a guide

### Three key settings: aperture, shutter speed, ISO

Metaphor used to introduce the three concepts

| Concept | Metaphor | e.g. Measure |
|---------|----------| --------|
| Aperture | Size of the window | f/8 |
| Shutter Speed | How long the blinds are open | 1/50 sec |
| ISO | How bright/dark the walls are | 400 |

### Try this on your camera

#### Aperture priority mode

1. Set your camera to Aperture Priority mode

2. Change the aperture and notice how the shutter speed changes to maintain exposure.

3. Observe the light meter indicator - it should stay centered if the exposure is balanced.


#### Full manual mode

1. Switch to full manual mode

2. Adjust all three settings.

3. Check how the light meter changes as you adjust settings.

4. take a correctly exposed shot

5. Initially take an underexposed shot

6. Then take an overexposed shot

7. How does the light meter reflect these changes?


## Histogram

Moving on from what is exposure and how to change exposure settings, to how to evaluate exposure using the histogram.

Histogram 

- provides a more consistent reference for evaluating exposure than the camera LCD (which is influenced by ambient light, screen brightness etc.)
- is based on the JPEG preview, not the RAW data
- a graphical representation of the shadows and light appearing in the image.
- Numerous continuous plots representing different parts of the light peaking along different parts of the X axis based on the proportion of the image
- Shadows to the left, highlights to the right.
- An 'ideal' histogram often resembles a bell curve spread across the entire width with nothing beyond the edges.

### Understanding histogram adjustments

- Increasing exposure shifts the histogram to the right, decreasing exposure shifts it to the left.

### What about colour?

- Histogram provides color data divided into three channels: Red, Green, and Blue.

### The "Expose to the Right" (ETTR) technique

- Digital cameras capture more detail in highlights than in shadows.
- Some photographers use ETTR because of this - by pushing the histogram to the right without clipping highlights, they aim to maximize detail in the image.

## Exposure Triangle

The ratio between: aperture, shutter speed, and ISO.

A new definition for these

| Concept | Definition |
| ---------|------------|
| ISO | Amplification to the sensor\nHigher ISO useful in darker scenes, lower ISO good for brighter scenes\nFixed feature of camera film, but adjustable in digital cameras |    
| Shutter speed | How long the sensor is exposed to light\nLonger it is open, the more light is recorded |
| Aperture | Size of the opening of the lens\nWide aperture (small number) allows more light in\nALso an important aspect in depth of field |

!!! Note "Depth of field"

    Depth of field is the range of distances of a photograph that appear in focus. Wider aperture create a shallow depth of field, often giving blurred backgrounds. Smaller apertures keep more of the scene in focus.

## Aperture

Measured in __f-stops__ aka __f-numbers__. Representing a ratio between the focal length of the lens and the diameter of the aperture opening.

F-stops represent fractions.  Hence f/2.8 is a larger aperture than f/16.

!!! question "Is the __f__ in f/2.8 short for 'focal length'?"

    Appears so, but it's not explicitly mentioned in the course material. That would make it much more obvious. Would also imply that if you change the focal length the actual diameter of the aperture changes to maintain the same f-number.

### Depth of field

Range of distances within a scene that appear acceptably sharp in an image.

Wider aperture (smaller f-number) gives a shallow depth of field - isolating the subject from foreground and background. Creating a pronounced blur in out-of-focus areas.

Narrower aperture (larger f-number) increases depth of field - keeping more of the scene in focus from foreground to background.

Other factors affecting depth of field

- distances between camera, subject, and background
- focal length of the lens

### Diffraction

- Diffraction is the bending and spreading of light waves as they pass through the aperture of a lens
- More noticeable at smaller apertures (high f-numbers)
- As the aperture decreases, light spreads out after passing through, rather than traveling in straight paths
- Eventually diffraction can reduce overall sharpness of the image


!!! note "Depth of field/sharpness trade-off"

    Important where detail matters: landscape work, macro photography or using high-resolution sensors.  As the depth of field increases (smaller aperture), diffraction may reduce sharpness.  Finding a balance between depth of field and sharpness is key.

    Can be lens dependent.

### Advanced aperture techniques

Bokeh shapes 

- custom shapes are made in black paper/cardboard that are placed over the lens
- wide aperture used to create shallow depth of field and introduce blurred light
- light sources in the background take on the shape of the cutout

Bokeh panorama (Brenizer method)

- uses a wide aperture lens to create a shallow depth of field
- multiple overlapping images are taken while panning the camera
- stitched together in post-processing to create a high-resolution image with a shallow depth of field

Focus stacking

- multiple images taken at different focus distances
- combined in post-processing to create an image with a greater depth of field than any single shot
- useful in macro photography or where subject is very close to the camera

## Depth of Field

Shallow depth of field main reason is to focus on the subject, bluring out background/foreground. e.g. portraits

Achieved with wide aperture (small f-number), longer focal length, and close subject distance.

### Deep depth of field

An image where a large portion of the scene appears in sharp focus.

### Bokeh

The aesthetic quality of the out-of-focus areas in a photograph. How the blur looks, not how much blur there is.

Common characteristics of good bokeh

- Smooth and creamy - without hard edges
- Pleasant shapes - often circular or hexagonal depending on lens aperture blades
- background separation - helps the subject stand out

## Shutter speed

## ISO


## Knowledge check


## Unit 2: Assignment - Scavenger Hunt

Aim is to explore the relationship between aperture and shutter speed by using (semi-)manual modes. Adjusting settings to observe how the impact depth of field, motion and overall exposure. Aiming to build familiarity with camera settings and analyse the trade-offs involved.

Select your strongest work, and reflect on the process

### Step 1: Capture images with different outcomes

Capture 6 different images to demonstrate the effect of aperture and shutter speed - see [[exposure-triangle-scavenger-hunt]]


### Step 2: Analyse exposure trade-offs

After making your photos, review the images and consider the following:

-   How did aperture changes affect depth of field?

-   How did shutter speed changes affect motion and light capture?

-   What challenges did you encounter when balancing exposure?

### Step 3: Bonus: Experiment with adjustments

Choose one image and try to achieve a similar visual result using a different approach.

For example, if you created motion blur with a slow shutter speed, try creating a similar effect using camera movement instead of subject motion.

### Reflect and share

Choose **5 final images** that demonstrate a range of exposure effects. Include a short written reflection addressing:

-   What you photographed, and why

-   How exposure choices affected your results

-   Which settings were most challenging

-   What type of feedback you want, such as technical, compositional, or narrative
