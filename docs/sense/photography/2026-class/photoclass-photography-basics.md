## Exposure

**Exposure**

- amount of light that reaches the camera's sensor
- how the sensor processes that light to create an image
- a pretty fundamental aspect of photography

Under and over exposure - too little or too much light reaching the sensor.

Well-exposed image has a balanced range of tones from dark to light, with details preserved in both shadows and highlights.

### How a camera measures light

Modern cameras have built-in light meters that suggest what the camera considers a 'correct' exposure - usually involves judging what the subject is and making its luminosity towards 18% gray.

What's next depends on the mode

-   **Auto mode:** The camera chooses all settings.

-  **Semi-automatic modes (Aperture or Shutter Priority):** You control one setting while the camera adjusts the others.

-   **Manual mode:** You set everything yourself, using the light meter as a guide

### Three key settings: aperture, shutter speed, ISO

Metaphor used to introduce the three concepts

| Concept | Metaphor | e.g. Measure |
|---------|----------| --------|
| Aperture | Size of the window | f/8 |
| Shutter Speed | How long the blinds are open | 1/50 sec |
| ISO | How bright/dark the walls are | 400 |

### Try this on your camera

#### Aperture priority mode

1. Set your camera to Aperture Priority mode

2. Change the aperture and notice how the shutter speed changes to maintain exposure.

3. Observe the light meter indicator - it should stay centered if the expsure is balanced.


#### Full manual mode

1. Switch to full manual mode

2. Adjust all three settings.

3. Check how the light meter changes as you adjust settings.

3. take a correctly exposed shot

4. Initially take an underexposed shot

5. Then take an overexposed shot

6. How does the light meter reflect these changes?

## Unit 2: Assignment - Scavenger Hunt

Aim is to explore the relationship between aperture and shutter speed by using (semi-)manual modes. Adjusting settings to observe how the impact depth of field, motion and overall exposure. Aiming to build familiarity with camera settings and analyse the trade-offs involved.

Select your strongest work, and reflect on the process

### Step 1: Capture images with different outcomes

Capture the following to demonstrate the effect of aperture and shutter speed.

-   **Portrait with bokeh:** Use a wide aperture and place your subject far from the background to create a shallow depth of field and blurred background.

-   **Landscape with deep focus:** Use a small aperture to keep most or all layers of the scene in sharp focus. 

-   **Frozen action:** Use a fast shutter speed to stop motion. Examples include: jumping, sports, moving vehicles, or fast-moving water.

-   **Light trails:** Use a slow shutter speed to record moving lights at night. 

-   **Smooth water:** Use a slow shutter speed to blur the motion of water in a fountain, river, sink, waterfall, etc.

-   **Intentional motion blur:** Use a slow shutter speed to blur movement creatively. For example, panning a moving subject, or capturing the energy of a busy scene.

### Step 2: Analyse exposure trade-offs

After making your photos, review the images and consider the following:

-   How did aperture changes affect depth of field?

-   How did shutter speed changes affect motion and light capture?

-   What challenges did you encounter when balancing exposure?

### Step 3: Bonus: Experiment with adjustments

Choose one image and try to achieve a similar visual result using a different approach.

For example, if you created motion blur with a slow shutter speed, try creating a similar effect using camera movement instead of subject motion.

### Reflect and share

Choose **5 final images** that demonstrate a range of exposure effects. Include a short written reflection addressing:

-   What you photographed, and why

-   How exposure choices affected your results

-   Which settings were most challenging

-   What type of feedback you want, such as technical, compositional, or narrative
