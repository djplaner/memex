## To do


Unit 1

- [ ] Explore photography on mastodon, including Pixelfed.
- [ ] Develop a photographic PKM process including use of [[photographic-inspirations]] note and perhaps the blog?
- [x] Add a current-photography-gear note listing current gear.
- [x] Consider my digital workflow
    - Select new DAM software - RawTherapee installed for trial.
    - Still using iPhoto
- [ ] Work through my camera's manual

Assignment 1

- [x] Revise the material on focal length etc and derive some points about impact on scene selection and composition.
- [ ] Ponder what scenes might work for the assignment.

    - Something to do with [[the-dam]] and its bird/plant life?
    - [[bunker]] and the ficus
