??? note "Current status - getting started"



??? note "To do"

    - [ ] Look through the "inspiration" links, find what might be interesting, and start weaving that into my [[pkm]] process.
    - [ ] Explore photography on mastodon, including Pixelfed.
    - [ ] Develop a photographic PKM process including use of [[photographic-inspirations]] note and perhaps the blog?
    - [ ] Add a current-photography-gear note listing current gear.

## Understanding photography

**G.A.S** - Gear Acquisition Syndrome.  Suggestion is that _the best camera is the one you have with your_ and the aim should be to know and push the boundaries of what you have. Learn its strengths and limits and move forward with gear based on those limitations.

### Why I am learning?

I have the time, purpose, and a lack of knowledge to fulfill that purpose. One of the biggest advantages of being retired is time. Time I'm filling with an increased focus on [[wood-duck-meadows|our home]]. As part of that focus, I want to visually record what is happening over time. Photography also offers a way to capture some of the experience of travel, family...

However, both my level of technical and artistic knowledge related to photography is embarrassingly low. Improve that knowledge and I'll improve my engagement with our environment.

Beyond that very purpose driven rationale, the nature of this quite large open course on a topic as storied and varied as photography will be diversity. There will be lots of other purposes, perspectives and examples to observe. Perhaps some of those will resonate.

### I am interested in...

Just about anything the course and the associated learning experience has to offer. Will particularly interested in landscape and nature photography. Finding out what else might interest me, is of interest.

### I already know...

The basics of how to use a camera. That knowledge and anything else is ad hoc with no basis in science or art.

## Inspiration and feedback

Finding where you can be inspired is seen as important.

Suggestions include

- Don't limit inspiration to photography - look at other art forms 
- Look for inspiration in colours, textures, composition, color theory, story telling...

The following is a copy of the suggested sources of inspiration provided in the course material.

Suggestions are also made for the "sense" part of a seek/sense/share process for inspiration, including: mood boards, or simply saving photos and details.

**Feedback**

- giving feedback requires you to be explicit and articulate what you see
- requesting feedback is enhanced by providing context, including: goals for the image; and, your thinking behind the process used
- even with limited photographic knowledge, the course suggests a life time of exposure to visual media provides people with an inherent understanding to draw on 
- feedback should be _constructive_ and _actionable_
    - identify why you're having your reaction
    - note what can be done to improve the image

### Who or what inspires me?

Immediately would be work that resonates with my purpose/interest. However, that's fairly general and might include content (flora, fauna etc), style (composition, colour, light etc) or technique (long exposure, macro etc). The latter something that's going to need to be developed through this course. Suggesting a PKM process aimed around gathering and sharing that type of work.

For example, perhaps adding a [[photographic-inspirations]] note and using that more purposefully. Perhaps with themes emerging throughout the class and beyond.

### How comfortable am I with feedback?

Not very comfortable giving feedback, definitely feel I'm under prepared in terms of knowledge and the ability to articulate. But that perhaps suggests why I should engage more in the process. i.e. giving more feedback will help develop that "muscle".

Receiving feedback, is something I feel more comfortable with. However, more experience of that may change that.

## What is a camera

A device for capturing light. A device with three main components.

### The sensor

A grid of light-collecting squares which determines how bright/dark an image is. Converts light into digital data which will form the photo. Film achieves a similar result using a chemical process.

Three main characteristics of sensors

1. Resolution - how many pixels. More is better, but five or six megapixels is enough for most purposes.
2. Physical size - affects field of view, depth of field, performance at high ISO and dynamic range.
3. Performance - harder to measure. Describes how well a sensor handles challenging lighting.

### The lens

Optical device that takes scattered light rays and focuses them onto the sensor. Modern lenses are complex with multiple optical elements. Quality of glass, coatings, and construction precision impact image quality.

No lens is perfect. The best are specialised.

Lens characteristics

- Focal length - roughy how wide or zoomed the lense can be. A zoom lens will have a focal length range, a prime lens a single focal length.
- maximum aperture - how wide the lens can open to let in light
- minimum focus distance - how close you can get to a subject and still focus
- auto/manual focus
- zoom scale

### The body

The light box that connects/coordinates between the sensor and lens.

## Types of cameras

- Mirrorless - light shine directly onto the sensor, at all times
- DSLR - a mirror is used to reflect light up into an optical viewfinder. When the photo is taken, the mirror flips up to allow light to reach the sensor.
- Compact - lens is permanently attached, cheap ones largely replaced with phones.
- Phone - relative small sensors, processing power. Usually fixed aperture.
- film
- exotics - largely ignored (people with an exotic probably aren't in an introductory course)


## Lenses

| Number | Description | My lens |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| 1:4 of f/4 | Max aperture | |
| 17-40mm | Focal length range. At 17mm a wider view fo the scene is captured. 40mm view is narrower | |
| 077mm | Filter size - the 0 symbol. The size of the filter  | |

## Focal length

See also - [[focal-length]]

Choosing focal length is a first step in composing

What

- physical property of the lens
- distance in mms between the len's optical center and the image plane when the lens is focused at infinity
- describes how wide/narrow a scene appears in a photograph
- lower focal length = wider view
- higher focal length = narrower view

!!! note "Distortion and compression"

    A portrait with a short focal length results in a distorted face and background far away - _extension distortion_.

    Portrait with long focal length makes the subject and background more compressed - foreground and background appear closer together - _compression distortion_.

    The distance from the camera to the subject is creating these distortions.

    Small focal lengths compress the apparent distance between foreground and background elements.

The size of the sensor impacts the angle of the view. There's more of the sensor beyond the center. It changes the _crop factor_ which is a ratio of the sensor to the 35mm film standard.

Specifying focal length should include mention of the camera.

!!! note "Compression - a visual effect of narrowing the perceived distance between elements of an image"

    Physical distance between photo and subject influences perspective. Not focal length. A low focal length lens will require a closer distance to the subject to fill the frame. 

    A reason why longer lens are often used for portraiture.

- [How lens compression and perspective distortion work](https://fstoppers.com/architecture/how-lens-compression-and-perspective-distortion-work-251737)

| Range | Focal length | Description | 
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| Ultra wide | 14-24mm | Exaggerated perspective, can make images cartoonish |
| Wide | 24-35mm | Wide enough for a lot of context, not so wide to look unnatural. A good "default" focal range |
| Normal | 40-75mm | Closest to what they eye sees. Liked by street photographers |
| Mid-telephoto | 85-105mm | Primary portrait category. Long enough to create separate, but short enough to enable subject communication |
| Medium telephoto | 120mm-300mm | Can be used in most genres. 
| Large and exotic telephoto | 300mm+ | Wildlife and sports |

## Raw vs Jpeg

Digital camera records a large set of numerical values to represent the light hitting each pixel on the sensor. To produce a visible image, numerous steps must be followed

- assigning color information
- applying white balance
- adjusting contrast
- sharpening
- setting saturation

Two methods

1. Camera does processing and generates a Jpeg image
2. Camera saves raw sensor data for later processing on a computer

Raw files provide more control over processing. Camera processing has become quite good.

### Example workflow

0. Configure camera settings

    - naming - include name/initials
    - date format and setting correct
    - add in copyright and creator info
    - configure save format
1. Import photos from camera to computer

    e.g. card reader

2. Star photos based on quick initial review

3. Process photos with particular star rating - update the star rating if processing results in a good outcome

    Processing includes updating relevant metadata and also DAM software tags/keywords.

4. Export "5 star" photos as JPEGs

5. Optional: upload to photo sharing site e.g. Flickr, Pixelfed, etc.

### Backups

3-2-1 backup strategy

3. Create at least 3 copies of your files
2. Store on 2 different types of media
1. Store 1 copy offsite

## Knowledge check

H5P quiz? Recaping introduced material. 100%

## Unit 1 Assignment

### The task

Create a short photo story (3-5 images) and take note of how camera choice or focal length shapes the final image.

3 parts

1. Pick a single scene or subject. A scene that stays the same.
2. Take two or more photos with the following approaches

    - Two cameras
    - one camera but two shooting distances
    - One camera but two focal lengths
3. Be thoughtful about how you approach the scene. Illustrate/see how these choices affect your final image, or your shooting style in the moment. Keep in mind

    - Manual or auto modes are both fine
    - Don't worry about technical execution
    - __For this lesson only__: no heavy editing. Light crop or straighten, but share SOOC Jpegs

4. Reflect and share

    Chose 2-4 images the clearly show how your choices affected the result. When sharing, including a short reflection, including:

    - What stayed the same across the images?
    - What changed, and why do you think it happened?
    - Which version felt closest to how you experienced the scene?
    - What kind of feedback are you hoping to receive?

What to submit

1. Your final 2-4 images
2. A short paragraph reflecting on the points above.
3 Optional: Past without labeling your approach and let others guess how the image was made.

### Why I chose this photo

### What I'd do differently 

## Assignment preparation

### Focal length and photo composition, story telling etc

Focal length's impacts

- how you frame the scene
- your position relative to the subject
- perspective exaggeration, perspective flattening, and the related concept of compression
- alter how foreground and background elements relate to each other

### Experiment - A matter of perspective

The underlying aim was to demonstrate that changes in focal length and distance to subject will impact perspective in an image.

See [[a-matter-of-perspective]]

### Experiment - Multiple attachments 

The next experiment was to to simply change focal length whilst maintaining distance.  Doing this means that the subject size must change, or depending on how you define subject, the subject changes.

See [[multiple-attachments]]
