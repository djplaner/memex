??? note "Current status - getting started"



??? note "To do"

    - [ ] Look through the "inspiration" links, find what might be interesting, and start weaving that into my [[pkm]] process.
    - [ ] Explore photography on mastodon, including Pixelfed.
    - [ ] Develop a photographic PKM process including use of [[photographic-inspirations]] note and perhaps the blog?
    - [ ] Add a current-photography-gear note listing current gear.

## Understanding photography

**G.A.S** - Gear Acquisition Syndrome.  Suggestion is that _the best camera is the one you have with your_ and the aim should be to know and push the boundaries of what you have. Learn its strengths and limits and move forward with gear based on those limitations.

### Why I am learning?

I have the time, purpose, and a lack of knowledge to fulfill that purpose. One of the biggest advantages of being retired is time. Time I'm filling with an increased focus on [[wood-duck-meadows|our home]]. As part of that focus, I want to visually record what is happening over time. Photography also offers a way to capture some of the experience of travel, family...

However, both my level of technical and artistic knowledge related to photography is embarrassingly low. Improve that knowledge and I'll improve my engagement with our environment.

Beyond that very purpose driven rationale, the nature of this quite large open course on a topic as storied and varied as photography will be diversity. There will be lots of other purposes, perspectives and examples to observe. Perhaps some of those will resonate.

### I am interested in...

Just about anything the course and the associated learning experience has to offer. Will particularly interested in landscape and nature photography. Finding out what else might interest me, is of interest.

### I already know...

The basics of how to use a camera. That knowledge and anything else is ad hoc with no basis in science or art.

## Inspiration and feedback

Finding where you can be inspired is seen as important.

Suggestions include

- Don't limit inspiration to photography - look at other art forms 
- Look for inspiration in colours, textures, composition, color theory, story telling...

The following is a copy of the suggested sources of inspiration provided in the course material.

Suggestions are also made for the "sense" part of a seek/sense/share process for inspiration, including: mood boards, or simply saving photos and details.

**Feedback**

- giving feedback requires you to be explicit and articulate what you see
- requesting feedback is enhanced by providing context, including: goals for the image; and, your thinking behind the process used
- even with limited photographic knowledge, the course suggests a life time of exposure to visual media provides people with an inherent understanding to draw on 
- feedback should be _constructive_ and _actionable_
    - identify why you're having your reaction
    - note what can be done to improve the image

### Who or what inspires me?

Immediately would be work that resonates with my purpose/interest. However, that's fairly general and might include content (flora, fauna etc), style (composition, colour, light etc) or technique (long exposure, macro etc). The latter something that's going to need to be developed through this course. Suggesting a PKM process aimed around gathering and sharing that type of work.

For example, perhaps adding a [[photographic-inspirations]] note and using that more purposefully. Perhaps with themes emerging throughout the class and beyond.

### How comfortable am I with feedback?

Not very comfortable giving feedback, definitely feel I'm under prepared in terms of knowledge and the ability to articulate. But that perhaps suggests why I should engage more in the process. i.e. giving more feedback will help develop that "muscle".

Receiving feedback, is something I feel more comfortable with. However, more experience of that may change that.

## What is a camera

A device for capturing light. A device with three main components.

### The sensor

A grid of light-collecting squares which determines how bright/dark an image is. Converts light into digital data which will form the photo. Film achieves a similar result using a chemical process.

Three main characteristics of sensors

1. Resolution - how many pixels. More is better, but five or six megapixels is enough for most purposes.
2. Physical size - affects field of view, depth of field, performance at high ISO and dynamic range.
3. Performance - harder to measure. Describes how well a sensor handles challenging lighting.

### The lens

Optical device that takes scattered light rays and focuses them onto the sensor. Modern lenses are complex with multiple optical elements. Quality of glass, coatings, and construction precision impact image quality.

No lens is perfect. The best are specialised.

Lens characteristics

- Focal length - roughy how wide or zoomed the lense can be. A zoom lens will have a focal length range, a prime lens a single focal length.
- maximum aperture - how wide the lens can open to let in light
- minimum focus distance - how close you can get to a subject and still focus
- auto/manual focus
- zoom scale

### The body

The light box that connects/coordinates between the sensor and lens.

## Types of cameras

- Mirrorless - light shine directly onto the sensor, at all times
- DSLR - a mirror is used to reflect light up into an optical viewfinder. When the photo is taken, the mirror flips up to allow light to reach the sensor.
- Compact - lens is permanently attached, cheap ones largely replaced with phones.
- Phone - relative small sensors, processing power. Usually fixed aperture.
- film
- exotics - largely ignored (people with an exotic probably aren't in an introductory course)


## Lenses

| Number | Description | My lens |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| 1:4 of f/4 | Max aperture | |
| 17-40mm | Focal length range. At 17mm a wider view fo the scene is captured. 40mm view is narrower | |
| 077mm | Filter size - the 0 symbol. The size of the filter  | |
