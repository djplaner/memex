    - Look through the "inspiration" links, find what might be interesting, and start weaving that into my [[pkm]] process.

## Understanding photography

**G.A.S** - Gear Acquisition Syndrome.  Suggestion is that _the best camera is the one you have with your_ and the aim should be to know and push the boundaries of what you have. Learn its strengths and limits and move forward with gear based on those limitations.

### Why I am learning?

I have the time, purpose, and a lack of knowledge to fulfill that purpose. One of the biggest advantages of being retired is time. Time I'm filling with an increased focus on [[wood-duck-meadows|our home]]. As part of that focus, I want to visually record what is happening over time. Photography also offers a way to capture some of the experience of travel, family...

However, both my level of technical and artistic knowledge related to photography is embarrassingly low. Improve that knowledge and I'll improve my engagement with our environment.

Beyond that very purpose driven rationale, the nature of this quite large open course on a topic as storied and varied as photography will be diversity. There will be lots of other purposes, perspectives and examples to observe. Perhaps some of those will resonate.

### I am interested in...

Just about anything the course and the associated learning experience has to offer. Will particularly interested in landscape and nature photography. Finding out what else might interest me, is of interest.

### I already know...

The basics of how to use a camera. That knowledge and anything else is ad hoc with no basis in science or art.

## Inspiration and feedback

Finding where you can be inspired is seen as important.

Suggestions include

- Don't limit inspiration to photography - look at other art forms 
- Look for inspiration in colours, textures, composition, color theory, story telling...

The following is a copy of the suggested sources of inspiration provided in the course material.
