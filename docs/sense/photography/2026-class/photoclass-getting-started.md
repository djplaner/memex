Unit 0 including working through some basic information about the course and watching a recording of an introduction/FAQ video. Perhaps the bit I engaged most in was trawling through some ancient photos from Flickr to select one I'm proud of.

Currently thinking I should be able to engage in the course and get something out of it.

??? success "Status complete"

    Completed on boxing day 2025.

    From a course design/implementation perspective, the combination of a website and discord server will suit me. The design of the intro tasks are appropriate. In particular, the "photo I'm proud of" tasks. People doing this course are likely to have a few and want to share.

    There appears to be a broad spectrum in experience/ability of participants. Will be interesting to see how that plays out.

    Personally, the chance to review some of my favourite photos (mostly those on Flickr) was an engaging experience.

## Learning journal questions

### Goals

**I hope to learn and achieve...**

Move beyond an essentially uninformed and ad hoc approach to photography by developing a more systematic understanding of the mechanics and artistry of photography. Leverage that understanding to better capture the world around me, particularly of [[wood-duck-meadows]].

**I am confident in my ability to**

Use the mechanics of the camera. Beyond that, not much, but confident I have the motivation and ability to learn.

### Photo I'm proud of...

Used this question as an opportunity to revisit past photos and develop a list of possibles.

**Why I chose this photo**

This is my favourite photo taken on a family trip almost 20 years ago. I can see a framed copy on the wall as I write. It's the combination of elements that I like. The combination of a stony beach, misty mountains in the background, ocean breakers rolling in, and the early morning sun breaking through the clouds. My untrained eye like what the lens flare adds to the image.

**What I'd do differently**

Based on my photography knowledge at the time, not much. However, but I would like to figure out possible changes/improvements after learning much more about photography. Hence the purpose behind undertaking this class.
