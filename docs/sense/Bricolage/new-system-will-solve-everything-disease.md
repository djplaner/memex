title: New System Will Solve Everything Disease
---
Eventually when problems with existing organisational information systems became sufficiently troubling for sufficiently important people it is important that it get solved. The [[set-mindset]] underpinning organisational information systems is based on the assumption that smart people can come design the solution, typically another, better system.

The problem is that many organisational problems are so complex and diverse that there is no right answer and no single system can provide that answer.

(A nascent idea)

Enabled by the tendency for people responsible for organisations and systems believe in [[engineering-the-right]]
