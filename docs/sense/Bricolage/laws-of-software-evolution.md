## Lehman (1996)

> 2.1 I -- Continuing Change 
> An E-type program that is used must be continually adapted else it becomes progressively less satisfactory.” ([Lehman, 1996, p. 108]

> 2.2 II -- Increasing Complexity 
> As a program is evolved its complezity increases unless work is done to maintain or reduce it.” ([Lehman, 1996, p. 109]

> 2.3 III -- Self Regulation 
> The program evolution process is self regulating with close to normal distribution of measures of product and process attributes. ([Lehman, 1996, p. 109]

> 2.4 IV -- Conservation of Organisational Stability (invariant work rate) 
> The average effective global activity rate on an evolving system is invariant over the product life time.” ([Lehman, 1996, p. 110])

> 2.5 -- Conservation of Familiarity 
> During the active life of an evolving program, the content of successive releases is statistically invariant.” ([Lehman, 1996, p. 110])

> 2.6 VI -- Continuing Growth 
> Functional content of a program must be continually increased to maintain user satisfaction over its lifetime.” ([Lehman, 1996, p. 110])

> 2.7 VII -- Declining Quality 
> E-type programs will be perceived as of declining quality unless rigorously maintained and adapted to a changing operational environment.” ([Lehman, 1996, p. 111])

> 2.8 VIII -- Feedback System 
> E-type Programming Processes constitute Multi-loop, Multi-level Feedback systems and must be treated as such to be successfully modified or improved.” ([Lehman, 1996, p. 112])
