> Citizen development, the development of software applications by staff that are not professional software developers, is an important trend in industry, and a critical component of Shell’s digitalisation journey. It empowers our staff to create bespoke solutions for their daily process out of the data available to them. That is how we unlock untapped value with digital solutions.

From the VP for DIY Software Development 

> Embracing the possibility that everyone, wherever they sit in the organisation can improve our operations by developing a software application is known within Shell as “do it yourself” software development. It delivers significant and rapid cost savings while supporting the democratization of digital skills among our staff.

> Citizen development is critical to our digitalisation journey. We empower those closest to the business problems to develop information technology (IT) applications and deliver bespoke solutions. Modern software tools, particularly in Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) environments, have revolutionised software development. Low-code or no-code applications have made it possible for nearly everyone to be a developer and create and generate value. It means that staff can create their own software with very little or no need for coding, within a safe and controlled environment. This is achieved through a self-service portal, comprehensive training and engaging communities.
