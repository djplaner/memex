## Lived complexity

Snowden thread which includes this quote - from Morin
> We need to go beyond an intellectual understanding of complexity, to an embodied lived complexity

### Snowden's initial take

From the same thread
>  is not about abandoning or rejecting that understanding, but about creating processes, constraints, methods etc. by which complexity can be lived (which is about enactment and extension as much as embodiment). It's about human interactions and connections its not about individual psychology change as the first driver or need - that will always emerge from new practices. Hence my focus on methods, tools and processes not dumbing things down
