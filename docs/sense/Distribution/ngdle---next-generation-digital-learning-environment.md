[EDUCAUSE define the NGDLE](https://www.educause.edu/ecar/research-publications/foundations-for-a-next-generation-digital-learning-environment-faculty-students-and-the-lms/ngdle-the-wave-of-the-future) as
> a digital learning architecture encompassing a confederation of learning applications, tools, and resources woven together by means of open standards.

In part, because of the inherent variety
> What is clear is that postsecondary learning is far too diverse to be enabled adequately by a single application or platform.  Therefore, it seems legitimate to conclude that any LMS will always need to be supplemented by additional components and resources, resulting in a digital learning environment instead of an LMS platform.

Raising the question of who decides what supplements are allowed?

[What's a NGDLE?](https://www.dontwasteyourtime.co.uk/elearning/whats-a-ngdle/) provides thoughts from David Hopkins. Includes pointers to thoughts from others and is inspired by [So what will a NGDLE look like](https://www.dontwasteyourtime.co.uk/elearning/whats-a-ngdle/) from Bryan Mathers which includes the following image. Which while including the Lego metaphor doesn't resonate with me because the lego base is very uniform - hiding the true complexity and ugliness of the base.

Ammie Moot's [Some more thoughts on the NDGDLE for what it's worth](https://ammienoot.com/uncategorized/some-more-thoughts-on-the-ngdle-for-what-its-worth/) is very good, mentioning (amongst other things)
- absence of student voices in the formulation of the NGDLE concept
- a tendency for the NGDLE to fetishise the technology and lacking broader thinking about "the digital"
- including the importance and place of the open web
- the reality of maintenance because "each LEGO brick in this NGDLE architecture is a moving part...and they're all moving at different speeds, shaped by different agendas, communities and commercial realities"
- absence of engagement with "issues of consent and control around data"
- raises the idea of the NGDLE being a suite of small, simple, lightly managed tools
