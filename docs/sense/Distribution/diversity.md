> Yeah. So my story is that most ideas are recombinations of existing ideas already circulating in the cultural milieu. So the more diverse minds are able to interact and share ideas, the more likely you are to create novel recombinations and lead to the diffusion of ideas. Even the famous geniuses like Einstein, if you look at special relativity, it’s a combination of a set of ideas that others were in the process of putting together, and he just happened to be the first guy to really congeal them together.
