## Salmon et al (2022)

Giving an overview of a model proposed by Stanton 

> "activated knowledge for a specific task within a system .... [and] the use of appropriate knowledge (held by individuals, captured by devices, etc.) which relates to the state of the environment and the changes as the situation develops" (Stanton et al., 2006, p. 1291).

An idea that built on earlier conceptualisations, such as
> They defined SA as "the active construction of a model of a situation partly shared and partly distributed between two or more agents, from which one can anticipate important future states in the near future" (Artman and Garbis 1998, p. 2).

Rejects the notion of shared SA as "misguided" because the goals and tasks of individual agents are different. Hence an interest in _compatible awareness_
