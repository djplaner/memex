# Hacker Ethos as Collective Intelligence



## Spark from _Coding Democracy_ 

From [this review](https://ancillaryreviewofbooks.org/2021/07/19/product-is-process-review-of-coding-democracy-by-maureen-webb/)

> My intent is to celebrate the hacking ethos, the collective intelligence of people, and the spirit in all of us to resist domination and unfairness.

The review links to the above via 

> While corporations and technocrats increasingly use networks to constrain, predict, and profit from collaborative human behavior, activists and visionaries want to liberate and expand the scope of social and political agency by designing systems in which bottom-up, unrestricted emergence can occur.
