> Below, we highlight and summarize four insights that arise from the Cultural and Collective Brain Hypotheses:

> 1. Innovation and cumulative cultural evolution depend heavily on the size, interconnectedness, and diversity of a population's or network's collective brain.

> 2. Individual smartness, or the ability of individuals to solve locally relevant problems, depends on the products of cumulative cultural evolution and thus on the collective brain.

> 3. With the rise of distributed cognition and an informational division of labor as well as the challenge of increasingly diverse problems, cultural evolutionary incentives favor effective problem-solving in small groups and at scale. The problem-solving abilities of groups depend heavily on their cognitive diversity and social psychology as well as a wide range of interactional, organizational, and epistemological norms.

> 4. Collective decision-making—the ability of groups to make smart decisions—depends on culturally evolved norms that govern the interactions among individuals and subgroups as well as the selection of leaders.
