# Notes from ["Learning Design SIG webinar on entangled pedagogy and learning design"](https://ascilite.org/events/learning-design-sig-webinar-on-entangled-pedagogy-and-learning-design/)

## Abstract

Entangled pedagogy challenges the notion that technology-first or pedagogy-first framings accurately describe the complex relationships between the different elements that contribute to any educational activity. It offers a framework for thinking about how these elements inevitably shape each other, and about the kinds of approaches and knowledge that can support educators to effectively navigate the messy, emergent spaces of teaching and learning. In this talk, our presenter will use the entangled pedagogy framework to think about the implications for learning design and how aspects of educational activity are inevitably interrelated and distributed across different kinds of staff and students, both constraining and strengthening possibilities for practice. The presentation will also briefly consider some implications for faculty development, technological adoption, different modalities of teaching (e.g. on campus, online and hybrid) and ethics.

### Question

How to move from the "actual" to the "aspirational"?  How to get beyond simply dealing with the entanglement to actually working toward specific, contextually appropriate purposes.

But that's actually what I'm doing - trying to make the contextual purposes become the driver.

### Where to start

Backwards design breaks down.
