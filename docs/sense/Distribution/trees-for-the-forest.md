title: Trees for the forest

One of two initial observations ([[forest-for-the-trees]] being the other) of an education system's attempts to improve learning and teaching at scale. Both are side effects of using a standardised, top-down, reductionist approach to a complex problem (see also [[ateleogical-versus-teleological]])

## Nascent definition

Being unable to see the _trees for the forest_ suggests that design focus is too far up the abstraction layer. Too divorced from context to truly engage effectively. Suggesting that it's a flavour of the [[reusability-paradox]] for many of the same reasons

A top-down, reductionist approach - especially when its being prescriptive (e.g. IT systems development; or institutional policy) simply cannot engage with all contextual realities. It has to abstract away certain specifics for the designers to be able to work with.
