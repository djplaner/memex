title: OER as a participatory activity
---

If OER is participatory, then the environment should support and encourage participation

> But Saylor Academy would absolutely benefit from infrastructure that would encourage us, our students, our partners, and members of the wider open community to really create the open content we need from the open content that we have.

The Moodle open book project is a small step toward that [site](https://davidtjones.wordpress.com/research/the-moodle-open-book-module-project/)

Which in turn raises the issue of the [[reusability-paradox]], [[distribution]], [[herding-cats]], [[bad-mindset]], [[affordances]], and [[bricolage]].
