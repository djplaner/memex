## Incentive versus cost

["exploring"](https://www.bhengagement.com/employee-rewards-recognition/)
> People weigh an incentive’s value against how hard it is to earn. Ask too much, and people will dismiss your incentive. Choose employee rewards that inherently have higher value, and you can inspire higher performance. Keep in mind that indulgences, especially those that don’t have to be justified, are more valuable. So are things that attract peer attention and stand out from regular pay.
