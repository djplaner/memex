# Worked examples

See also: [[teaching]], [[teaching-mathematics]]

Arising out of cognitive load theory demonstrates the steps required to complete a task. Benefit arises from the explanations of each step taken and then learners using self-explanations to describe the steps.

Effectiveness reduces as the learner gains increased expertise. An approach perhaps best applied to algorithmic skill domains where there a single correct solutions.

Zhu & Simon (1987) demonstrate how worked examples can be used to replace lectures and direct instruction.

> Fortunately for the feasibility of students' learning to factor, these rules are easier to understand in the context of examples and problems than they are when thus stated in prose (Zhu & Simon, 1987)
