See also: [[teaching]]

## Strategies

### Behaviour specific praise (Simpson et al, 2020)

Specifically acknowledge appropriate behaviour. 

Before instruction 

1. Identify times and settings in which challenging behaviors occur 
2. Determine specific and positive behaviors to target and collect baseline data 

During instruction 

3. Discuss expectations and model desired behaviors with students 
4. Provide explicit and timely behavior-specific praise to students when displayed

After instruction 

5. Continue data collection and providing behavior specific praise to increase rates of target behaviors 
6. When data show increase in target behavior, return to Step 1 and repeat process with new target behavior


### Good Behaviour Game (Simpson et al, 2020)

Before instruction 

1. Identify times and settings in which challenging behaviors occur 
2. Divide students into teams and name teams 
3. Determine rewards for winning team (preference assessment) 
4. Define appropriate and inappropriate behaviors and post as rules 
5. Determine winning requirements 
6. Explain rules to students how points will be earned or taken away 
7. Explicitly model appropriate behaviors 

During instruction 

8. Award and remove points based on rules determined in Step 4 
9. Provide prompts and feedback to inappropriate behaviors 

After instruction 

10. Winning team receives previously determined reward 
11. 11 Return to Step 1 and begin process again
