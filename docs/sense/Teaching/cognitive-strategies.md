## Three groups

McCrindle and Christensen (1995, p. 170-171) describe three groups of cognitive strategies proposed by Weinstein and Mayer (1986)

| Strategy | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Rehearsal | "refers to the repetition of to-be-learned information in a form relatively unchanged from the form in which it is given. Oral repetition, underlining, copying and making selective verbatim notes are all examples of rehearsal strategies." |
| Organisation | "involves the rearrangement of the to-be-learned information in a way that makes learning more meaningful. Thus, organizational strategies aid in the selection of information to be transferred to long-term memory and the construction of relationships among ideas embedded in the information. Examples of organizational strategies include grouping, sorting, categorizing, development of hierarchies and constructing networks." |
| Elaboration | "provide the most comprehensive transformation of the tobe-learned information. Elaboration strategies extend beyond the given knowledge and thus, help create linkages between the individual’s existing knowledge and the new information. Examples of elaboration strategies include using mental images, paraphrasing text, creating analogies, generative note taking and self-questioning." |
