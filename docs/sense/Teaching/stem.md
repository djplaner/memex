From the document - [QCAA STEM in Queensland Schools](https://www.qcaa.qld.edu.au/downloads/aciq/stem-resources/teaching/ac_stem_qld_schools.pdf)

> STEM education refers collectively to the teaching og Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics disciplines.

Why is it important

> STEM is part of everyday life and an increasing part of every workplace. STEM education enables students to develop solutions to complex problems and provides them with literacies and capabilities that will help them succeed in a world of technological change.

> _STEM literacy_ involves the use of foundational knowledge and skills from STEM learning areas through a **problem-based or inquiry approach** (emphasis added), to create solutions. It may involve:
> - identifying issues and problems 
> - posing questions 
> - providing explanations
> - drawing evidence-based conclusions
> - creating solutions

Much more interesting (sadly) the reasons why "schools should invest in STEM education" are

- STEM affects the economy
- Future employment trends
- It's what employers want
