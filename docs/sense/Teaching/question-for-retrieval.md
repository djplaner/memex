# Questioning for retrieval


## Questioning for retrieval: five mistakes to avoid

Guidance 

1. Cold call 
2. Wait 3 seconds
3. Ask a specific student 
4. Correct wrong answers
5. Offer a hint if needed

Mistakes 

1. Asking for hands up

	Confident students tend to answer. Warning class that teacher will choose encourages all students to be thinking about the answer.
2. Mostly asking the boys
3. Bouncing the question to another student (too early)
4. Don't round up a wrong answer to a right one
5. Talking too much
