> manipulate formulas involving several variables using digital tools, and describe the effect of systematic variation in the values of the variables

Elaborations


- _AC9M7A06_E1_ - experimenting with different sets of tables of values from formulas; for example, using volume of a rectangular prism = length × width × height, and specifying a fixed width and equal length and varying the height

- _AC9M7A06_E2_ - using spreadsheets and the formula function to recognise the effect of changing parameters on the entries in cells

- _AC9M7A06_E3_ - analysing distance travelled for different combinations of average speed and time of travel using a table of values and the distance formula
