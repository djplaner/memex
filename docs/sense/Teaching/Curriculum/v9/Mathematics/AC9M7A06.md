> manipulate formulas involving several variables using digital tools, and describe the effect of systematic variation in the values of the variables

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M7A06_E1_ - experimenting with different sets of tables of values from formulas; for example, using volume of a rectangular prism = length × width × height, and specifying a fixed width and equal length and varying the height
	- _AC9M7A06_E2_ - using spreadsheets and the formula function to recognise the effect of changing parameters on the entries in cells
	- _AC9M7A06_E3_ - analysing distance travelled for different combinations of average speed and time of travel using a table of values and the distance formula
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT707_ - Students use algebraic expressions to represent situations, describe the relationships between variables from authentic data  and substitute values into formulas to determine unknown values.
	- _ASMAT709_ - Students create tables of values related to algebraic expressions and formulas, and describe the effect of variation.
