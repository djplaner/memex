> describe the position and location of objects in 3 dimensions in different ways, including using a three-dimensional coordinate system with the use of dynamic geometric software and other digital tools

Elaborations


- _AC9M8SP03_E1_ - locating aircraft/drones using latitude, longitude and altitude as a three-dimensional coordinate system

- _AC9M8SP03_E2_ - constructing three-dimensional objects using \(3\)D printers or designing software that uses a three-dimensional coordinate system

- _AC9M8SP03_E3_ - comparing and contrasting two-dimensional and three-dimensional coordinate systems by highlighting what is the same and what is different, including virtual maps versus street views

- _AC9M8SP03_E4_ - using dynamic geometry software to construct shapes and objects within the first octant of a three-dimensional coordinate system

- _AC9M8SP03_E5_ - interpreting  three-dimensional coordinate locations for objects in multi-storey car parks; playing games based on  three-dimensional coordinate systems such as  three-dimensional Noughts and Crosses (Tic-Tac-Toe)

- _AC9M8SP03_E6_ - exploring position and transformation through geospatial technologies used by First Nations Australians’ communities
