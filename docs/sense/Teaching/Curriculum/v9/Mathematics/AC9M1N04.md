> add and subtract numbers within 20, using physical and virtual materials, part-part-whole knowledge to 10 and a variety of calculation strategies

Elaborations


- _AC9M1N04_E1_ - using drawings, physical and virtual materials and number combinations within \(10\) to add and subtract collections to \(20\)

- _AC9M1N04_E2_ - adding and subtracting numbers within \(20\), using a variety of representations and strategies such as counting on, counting back, partitioning and part-part-whole knowledge of numbers to \(10\); for example, using partitioning and combining \(7+5=7+3+2=10+2=12\)

- _AC9M1N04_E3_ - developing and using strategies for one-digit addition and subtraction based on part-part-whole relationships for each of the numbers to \(10\) and subitising with physical and virtual materials; for example, \(8\) and \(6\) is the same as \(8\) and \(2\) and \(4\)

- _AC9M1N04_E4_ - representing story problems involving addition and subtraction of numbers within \(20\) using a Think Board, recognising and using  + and – symbols and the equal sign to represent the operations of addition and subtraction; showing and explaining the connections between any materials used using the language of plus and minus, and the numbers within the story problem

- _AC9M1N04_E5_ - creating and performing addition and subtraction stories told through First Nations Australians’ dances
