> establish properties of quadrilaterals using congruent triangles and angle properties, and solve related problems explaining reasoning

Elaborations


- _AC9M8SP02_E1_ - establishing the properties of squares, rectangles, parallelograms, rhombuses, trapeziums and kites using geometric properties and proof, such as the sum of the exterior angles of a polygon is equal to a complete turn or \(360\)Â°

- _AC9M8SP02_E2_ - identifying properties of quadrilaterals related to side lengths, parallel sides, angles, diagonals and symmetry

- _AC9M8SP02_E3_ - applying the properties of triangles and quadrilaterals to construction designs such as car jacks, scissor lifts, folding umbrellas, toolboxes and cherry pickers
