> establish properties of quadrilaterals using congruent triangles and angle properties, and solve related problems explaining reasoning

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M8SP02_E1_ - establishing the properties of squares, rectangles, parallelograms, rhombuses, trapeziums and kites using geometric properties and proof, such as the sum of the exterior angles of a polygon is equal to a complete turn or \(360\)Â°
	- _AC9M8SP02_E2_ - identifying properties of quadrilaterals related to side lengths, parallel sides, angles, diagonals and symmetry
	- _AC9M8SP02_E3_ - applying the properties of triangles and quadrilaterals to construction designs such as car jacks, scissor lifts, folding umbrellas, toolboxes and cherry pickers
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT815_ - Students apply the properties of quadrilaterals to solve problems.
