> apply knowledge of equivalence to compare, order and represent common fractions including halves, thirds and quarters on the same number line and justify their order

Elaborations


- _AC9M6N03_E1_ - applying factors and multiples to fraction denominators, such as halves with quarters, eighths and twelfths, and thirds with sixths, ninths and twelfths to determine equivalent representations of fractions in order to make comparisons

- _AC9M6N03_E2_ - representing fractions on the same number line, paying attention to relative position, and using this to explain relationships between denominators

- _AC9M6N03_E3_ - explaining equivalence and order between fractions using number lines, drawings and models

- _AC9M6N03_E4_ - comparing and ordering fractions by placing cards on a string line across the room and referring to benchmark fractions to justify their position; for example, \(\frac58\) is greater than \(\frac12\) can be written as \(\frac58>\frac12\), because half of \(8\) is \(4\); \(\frac16\) is less than \(\frac14\), because \(6 > 4\) and can be written \(\frac16\) < \(\frac14\)
