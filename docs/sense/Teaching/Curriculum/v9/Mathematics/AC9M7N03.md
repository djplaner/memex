> represent natural numbers in expanded notation using place value and powers of 10

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M7N03_E1_ - investigating exponent notation for powers of \(10\) such as “one hundred thousand” is  \(100 000=10×10×10×10×10=10^5\)
	- _AC9M7N03_E2_ - relating the sequences \(10, 100, 1000, 10 000\) … and \(10^1\), \(10^2\), \(10^3\), \(10^4\) ...
	- _AC9M7N03_E3_ - applying and explaining the connections between place value and expanded notations; for example, \(7000=7×10^3\) and \(3750=3×10^3+7×10^2+5×10^1\)
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT701_ - By the end of Year 7, students represent natural numbers in expanded form and as products of prime factors, using exponent notation.
