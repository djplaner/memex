> identify corresponding, alternate and co-interior relationships between angles formed when parallel lines are crossed by a transversal; use them to solve problems and explain reasons

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M7M04_E1_ - constructing a pair of parallel lines and a pair of perpendicular lines using their properties, a pair of compasses and a ruler, set squares or using dynamic geometry software
	- _AC9M7M04_E2_ - using dynamic geometry software to identify relationships between alternate, corresponding and co-interior angles for a pair of parallel lines cut by a transversal
	- _AC9M7M04_E3_ - using dynamic geometry software to demonstrate how angles and their properties are involved in the design and construction of scissor lifts, folding umbrellas, toolboxes and cherry pickers
	- _AC9M7M04_E4_ - using geometric reasoning of angle properties to generalise the angle relationships of parallel lines and transversals, and related properties such as the size of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the sizes of opposite and non-adjacent interior angles, and the sum of the sizes of interior angles in a triangle in the plane is equal to the size of \(2\) right angles or \(180\)°
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT710_ - They apply knowledge of angle relationships and the sum of angles in a triangle to solve problems, giving reasons.
