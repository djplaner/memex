> interpret and compare data sets for ordinal and nominal categorical, discrete and continuous numerical variables using comparative displays or visualisations and digital tools; compare distributions in terms of mode, range and shape

Elaborations


- _AC9M6ST01_E1_ - determining the range for a numerical data set by finding the difference between the highest and the lowest value in the set and comparing the range for different data sets

- _AC9M6ST01_E2_ - representing acquired numerical data sets using side-by-side column graphs, comparing the spread of each data set using the range, the highest frequency for each data set using the mode, and discussing the shape

- _AC9M6ST01_E3_ - representing ordinal data collected through surveys, using visualisation tools including dot plots and bar charts, and discussing the distribution of data in terms of shape

- _AC9M6ST01_E4_ - using technology to access data sets and graphing software to construct side-by-side column graphs or stacked line graphs; comparing data sets that are grouped by gender, year level, age group or other variables and discussing findings
