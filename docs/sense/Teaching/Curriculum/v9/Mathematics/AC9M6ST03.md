Elaborations


- _AC9M6ST03_E1_ - selecting and using appropriate peripherals; for example, using a scientific probe to collect data about changing soil moisture for plants, interpreting the data and sharing the results as a digital chart

- _AC9M6ST03_E2_ - using a spreadsheet to record and analyse data, recognising the difference between cell formats in spreadsheets; for example, changing the default general format to numerical, text or date as needed

- _AC9M6ST03_E3_ - investigating the daily water usage by a student in the home compared to the World Health Organization claim of 50 litres of clean water allocated per person per day

- _AC9M6ST03_E4_ - collecting sample sets of “discrete numerical data”; for example, the number of cars or pets in a household, where the class is surveyed, then other classes are surveyed, and data is analysed and compared, discussing findings

- _AC9M6ST03_E5_ - collecting ordinal categorical data through the use of a survey; for example, surveying each member of the class where they are asked to indicate their preference on a five-point scale for a particular graphic and colour combination of a proposed school logo

- _AC9M6ST03_E6_ - collecting ordinal data for ranking nominees for school captain with respect to several criteria, contrasting the use of a five-point scale compared with using a four-point scale
