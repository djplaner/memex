> identify angles as measures of turn and compare angles with right angles in everyday situations

Elaborations


- _AC9M3M05_E1_ - using quarter, half and three-quarter turns and comparing them to a right angle; for example, a quarter turn is the same as a right angle; a half a turn is greater than a right angle and is the same as \(2\) right angles; a three-quarter turn is greater than a right angle and is the same as \(3\) right angles

- _AC9M3M05_E2_ - recognising that right angles occur at the corners of many everyday objects; for example, books, windows, table tops and whiteboards

- _AC9M3M05_E3_ - identifying angles that are bigger than, smaller than and the same as a right angle in the environment; for example, opening doors partially and fully and comparing the angles created to a right angle

- _AC9M3M05_E4_ - exploring First Nations Australian childrenâ€™s instructive games to investigate angles as measures of turn; for example, the game Waayin from the Datiwuy People in the northern part of the Northern Territory
