> list all outcomes for compound events both with and without replacement, using lists, tree diagrams, tables or arrays; assign probabilities to outcomes

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M9P01_E1_ - discussing two-step chance experiments, such as the game of Heads and Tails, describing the different outcomes and their related probabilities
	- _AC9M9P01_E2_ - using systematic methods such as lists or arrays to record outcomes and assign probabilities, such as drawing the names of students from a bag to appoint \(2\) team leaders
	- _AC9M9P01_E3_ - using a tree diagram to represent a three-stage event and assigning probabilities to these events; for example, selecting \(3\) cards from a deck, assigning the probability of drawing an ace, then a king, then a queen of the same suit, with and without replacing the cards after every draw
	- _AC9M9P01_E4_ - assigning probabilities to compound events involving the random selection of people from a given population; for example, selecting \(2\) names at random from all of the students at a high school and assigning the probability that they are both in Year 9
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT918_ - They determine sets of outcomes for compound events and represent these in various ways.
	- _ASMAT919_ - Students assign probabilities to the outcomes of compound events.
	- _ASMAT920_ - They design and conduct experiments or simulations for combined events using digital tools.
