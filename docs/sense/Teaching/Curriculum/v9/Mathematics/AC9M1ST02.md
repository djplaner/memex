> represent collected data for a categorical variable using one-to-one displays and digital tools where appropriate; compare the data using frequencies and discuss the findings

Elaborations


- _AC9M1ST02_E1_ - creating a pictograph with objects or drawings; discussing the possible categories for the pictograph, arranging the objects or drawings into the categories, then reflecting on the chosen categories and deciding whether they were helpful

- _AC9M1ST02_E2_ - translating data from a list or pictorial display into a tally chart to make counting easier; describing what the tally chart is showing, by referring to the categories; using skip counting by fives to compare the numbers within each category and explaining how the tally chart answers the question

- _AC9M1ST02_E3_ - recognising that when there is no data for a particular category you may choose whether or not to include it in your data display, and use a zero or blank for that category depending on the purpose of the data collection or presentation; for example, creating a birthday calendar for the class and discussing that there are no students born in May and therefore there are no names listed

- _AC9M1ST02_E4_ - representing data with objects and drawings where one object or drawing represents one data value; describing the displays and explaining patterns that have been created using counting strategies to determine the frequency of responses

- _AC9M1ST02_E5_ - exploring First Nations Australian childrenâ€™s instructive games; for example, Kolap from Mer Island in the Torres Strait region, recording the outcomes, representing and discussing the results
