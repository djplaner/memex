> design, test and refine solutions to spatial problems using algorithms and digital tools; communicate and justify solutions

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M10SP03_E1_ - designing and making scale models of three-dimensional objects using digital tools; for example, making components of a puzzle using a three-dimensional printer, planning and designing the puzzle using principles of tessellations
	- _AC9M10SP03_E2_ - applying a computational thinking approach to solving problems involving networks; for example, connectedness, coverage and weighted measures; taking different routes and choosing the most efficient route to take when travelling by car using virtual map software
	- _AC9M10SP03_E3_ - defining and decomposing spatial problems, creating and applying algorithms to generate solutions, evaluating and communicating solutions in terms of the problem; for example, designing a floor plan for a department store that limits congestion at key areas such as checkouts, changing rooms and popular sale items
	- _AC9M10SP03_E4_ - designing, creating and testing algorithms using pseudocode or flow charts for producing self-similar patterns; validating algorithms using a range of test cases to compare their output
	- _AC9M10SP03_E5_ - exploring geospatial technologies used by First Nations Australians’ communities to consider spatial problems including position and transformation
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT1010_ - They use deductive reasoning, theorems and algorithms to solve  spatial problems.
