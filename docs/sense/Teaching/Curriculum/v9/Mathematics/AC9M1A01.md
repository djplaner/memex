> recognise, continue and create pattern sequences, with numbers, symbols, shapes and objects, formed by skip counting, initially by twos, fives and tens

Elaborations


- _AC9M1A01_E1_ - using number charts, songs, rhymes and stories to establish skip counting sequences of twos, fives and tens

- _AC9M1A01_E2_ - using shapes and objects to represent a growing pattern formed by skip counting; for example, using blocks or beads to represent the growing patterns \(2, 4, 6, 8, 10\) … and \(5, 10, 15, 20\) …

- _AC9M1A01_E3_ - recognising the patterns in sequences formed by skip counting; for example, that skip counting in fives starting from zero always results in either a \(5\) or zero as the final digit

- _AC9M1A01_E4_ - counting by twos, fives, or tens to determine how much money is in a collection of coins or notes of the same denomination; for example, \(5\) cent, \(10\) cent and \(\$2\) coins, or \(\$5\) and \(\$10\) notes

- _AC9M1A01_E5_ - <p>using different variations of the popular Korean counting game <em>Sam-yuk-gu</em> for generating skip counting pattern sequences</p>
