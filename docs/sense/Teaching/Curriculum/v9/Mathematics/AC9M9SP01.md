> recognise the constancy of the sine, cosine and tangent ratios for a given angle in right-angled triangles using properties of similarity

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M9SP01_E1_ - understanding the terms “base”, “altitude”, “hypotenuse”, and “adjacent” and “opposite” sides to an angle, in a right-angled triangle, and identifying these for a given right-angled triangle
	- _AC9M9SP01_E2_ - investigating patterns to reason about nested similar triangles that are aligned on a coordinate plane, connecting ideas of parallel sides and identifying the constancy of ratios of corresponding sides for a given angle
	- _AC9M9SP01_E3_ - establishing an understanding that the sine of an angle can be considered as the length of the altitude of a right-angled triangle with a hypotenuse of length one unit and similarly the cosine as the length of the base of the same triangle, and relating this to enlargement and similar triangles
	- _AC9M9SP01_E4_ - relating the tangent of an angle to the altitude and base of nested similar right-angled triangles, and connecting the tangent of the angle at which the graph of a straight line meets the positive direction of the horizontal coordinate axis to the gradient of the straight line
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT911_ - Students apply Pythagoras’ theorem and use trigonometric ratios to solve problems involving right-angled triangles.
	- _ASMAT912_ - They use mathematical modelling to solve practical problems involving direct proportion, ratio and scale, evaluating the model and communicating their methods and findings.
