> recognise and read the time represented on an analog clock to the hour, half-hour and quarter-hour

Elaborations


- _AC9M2M04_E1_ - creating an analog clock from a paper plate, showing the placement of the numbers and the \(2\) hands; explaining how long it takes for the \(2\) hands to move around the clock face and what time unit each is showing

- _AC9M2M04_E2_ - recognising and describing the relationship between the movement of the hands on an analog clock and the duration of time it represents; for example, connecting the language of “half past” to mean when the “big hand” will be at half past the hour and recognising this position as being halfway around its full cycle

- _AC9M2M04_E3_ - dividing a clockface into halves and quarters, and connecting the subdivisions with telling the time to the half and quarter hour; explaining the meaning of “quarter past” and “quarter to” referring to the hour
