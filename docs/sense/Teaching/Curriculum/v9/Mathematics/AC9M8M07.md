> use mathematical modelling to solve practical problems involving ratios and rates, including financial contexts; formulate problems; interpret and communicate solutions in terms of the situation, reviewing the appropriateness of the model

Elaborations


- _AC9M8M07_E1_ - modelling and solving problems related to situations such as scales on maps and plans, the mixing of chemicals or ingredients, or calculating magnification factors applying relevant ratios and proportions

- _AC9M8M07_E2_ - modelling problems involving converting money amounts using different exchange rates and applying them when planning and budgeting for overseas travel

- _AC9M8M07_E3_ - modelling situations involving financial contexts; for example, income tax, using taxation rates on annual income, comparing different taxation brackets and rates of pay; comparing the benefits of different phone plans using different call rates and associated fees to determine the best plan

- _AC9M8M07_E4_ - modelling situations involving the use of ratios in radiocarbon dating methods, including the ratio of carbon-\(14\) to carbon-\(12\) isotopes in organisms, to measure dates of First Peoples of Australia’s habitation on the Australian continent

- _AC9M8M07_E5_ - modelling situations involving ratio and its application in the making of string and cordage by First Nations Australians, including the ratio of length to the mass of a rope, the strength of the ply in proportion to a rope’s pulling force, and the proportion of fibre for the length of string required
