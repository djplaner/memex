> conduct repeated chance experiments and run simulations with an increasing number of trials using digital tools; compare observations with expected results and discuss the effect on variation of increasing the number of trials

Elaborations


- _AC9M6P03_E1_ - using digital tools to simulate multiple tosses of a coin or dice and comparing the relative frequency of an outcome as the number of trials increases; identifying the variation between trials and realising that the results tend to the prediction with larger numbers of trials

- _AC9M6P03_E2_ - using online simulations of repeated random events to recognise emerging patterns, discussing and comparing expected results to the actual results

- _AC9M6P03_E3_ - investigating the relative frequencies of all outcomes for a chance experiment and verifying that their sum equals one

- _AC9M6P03_E4_ - systematically recording the outcome of large numbers of spins on a spinner and analysing the relative frequencies of outcomes, representing these as percentages
