- _AC9MFN02_E2_ - playing instructive card games that rely on the recognition of numbers represented in different ways; for example, playing memory games, matching pairs of quantities on dot cards or similar where the arrangement on each is different; using subitising to compare and order collections and to say who has more when sharing items in a game
