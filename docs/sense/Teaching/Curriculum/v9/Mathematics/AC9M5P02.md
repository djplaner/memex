> conduct repeated chance experiments including those with and without equally likely outcomes, observe and record the results; use frequency to compare outcomes and estimate their likelihoods

Elaborations


- _AC9M5P02_E1_ - discussing and listing all the possible outcomes of an activity and conducting experiments to estimate the probabilities; for example, using coloured cards in a card game and experimenting with shuffling the deck and turning over one card at a time, recording and discussing the results

- _AC9M5P02_E2_ - conducting experiments, recording the outcomes and the number of times the outcomes occur, describing the relative frequency of each outcome; for example, using “I threw the coin \(10\) times, and the results were \(3\) times for a head, so that is \(3\) out of \(10\), and \(7\) times for a tail, so that is \(7\) out of \(10\)”

- _AC9M5P02_E3_ - experimenting with and comparing the outcomes of spinners with equal-coloured regions compared to unequal regions; responding to questions such as “How does this spinner differ to one where each of the colours has an equal chance of occurring?”, giving reasons

- _AC9M5P02_E4_ - comparing the results of experiments using a fair dice and one that has numbers represented on faces more than once, explaining how this affects the likelihood of outcomes

- _AC9M5P02_E5_ - using spreadsheets to record the outcomes of an activity and calculate the total frequencies of different outcomes, representing these as a fraction; for example, using coloured balls in a bag, drawing one out at a time and recording the colour, replacing them in the bag after each draw

- _AC9M5P02_E6_ - investigating First Nations Australian children’s instructive games; for example, Diyari koolchee from the Diyari Peoples near Lake Eyre in South Australia, to conduct repeated trials and explore predictable patterns, using digital tools where appropriate
