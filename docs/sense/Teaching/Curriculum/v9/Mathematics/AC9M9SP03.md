> design, test and refine algorithms involving a sequence of steps and decisions based on geometric constructions and theorems; discuss and evaluate refinements

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M9SP03_E1_ - creating an algorithm using pseudocode or flow charts to apply the triangle inequality, or an algorithm to generate Pythagorean triples
	- _AC9M9SP03_E2_ - creating and testing algorithms designed to construct or bisect angles, using pseudocode or flow charts
	- _AC9M9SP03_E3_ - developing an algorithm for an animation of a geometric construction, or a visual proof, evaluating the algorithm using test cases
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT915_ - Students design, use and test algorithms based on geometric constructions or theorems.
