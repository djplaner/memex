> apply deductive reasoning to proofs involving shapes in the plane and use theorems to solve spatial problems

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M10SP01_E1_ - distinguishing between a practical demonstration and a proof; for example, demonstrating that triangles are congruent by placing them on top of each other, as compared to using congruence tests to establish that triangles are congruent
	- _AC9M10SP01_E2_ - developing proofs involving congruent triangles and angle properties, communicating the proof using a sequence of logically connected statements
	- _AC9M10SP01_E3_ - applying an understanding of relationships to deduce properties of geometric figures; for example, the base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal
	- _AC9M10SP01_E4_ - investigating proofs of geometric theorems and using them to solve spatial problems; for example, applying logical reasoning and similarity to proofs and numerical exercises involving plane shapes; using visual proofs to justify solutions
	- _AC9M10SP01_E5_ - using dynamic geometric software to investigate the shortest path that touches 3 sides of a rectangle, starting and finishing at the same point and proving that the path forms a parallelogram
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT1010_ - They use deductive reasoning, theorems and algorithms to solve  spatial problems.
