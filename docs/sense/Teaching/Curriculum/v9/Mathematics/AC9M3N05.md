> estimate the quantity of objects in collections and make estimates when solving problems to determine the reasonableness of calculations

Elaborations


- _AC9M3N05_E1_ - estimating how much space a grid paper representation of a large number such as \(20â€‰200\) will take up on the wall and how much paper will be required

- _AC9M3N05_E2_ - estimating the number of people in a large gathering; for example, school assembly, using known numbers, such as how many students per class

- _AC9M3N05_E3_ - choosing which place value they would estimate to for different situations; for example, they would estimate to the nearest \(10\) when estimating how many dots on a ladybird or they would estimate to the nearest \(1000\) when estimating crowd sizes at a venue

- _AC9M3N05_E4_ - checking the reasonableness of an addition calculation by using two- and three-digit numbers to the nearest \(10\) or hundred to estimate; for example, using \(200 + 400 = 600\) to estimate and check the solution to the calculation \(219 + 385\)
