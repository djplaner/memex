> expand, factorise and simplify expressions and solve equations algebraically, applying exponent laws involving products, quotients and powers of variables, and the distributive property

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M10A01_E1_ - explaining the relationship between factorisation and expansion, including the completed square form for quadratic expressions
	- _AC9M10A01_E2_ - applying knowledge of exponent laws to algebraic terms and using both positive and negative integral exponents to simplifying algebraic expressions and solve equations algebraically
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT1002_ - They use mathematical modelling to solve problems involving growth and decay in financial and other applied situations, applying  linear,  quadratic and exponential functions as appropriate, and solve related equations, numerically and graphically.
