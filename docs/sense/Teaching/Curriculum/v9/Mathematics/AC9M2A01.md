> recognise, describe and create additive patterns that increase or decrease by a constant amount, using numbers, shapes and objects, and identify missing elements in the pattern

Elaborations


- _AC9M2A01_E1_ - creating a pattern sequence with materials, writing the associated number sequence, and then describing the sequence so someone else can replicate it with different materials; for example, using matchsticks or toothpicks to create a growing pattern of triangles using \(3\) for one triangle, \(5\) for \(2\) triangles, \(7\) for \(3\) triangles and describing the pattern as “Start with \(3\) and add \(2\) each time”

- _AC9M2A01_E2_ - recognising patterns in the built environment to locate additive pattern sequences; for example, “How many windows in one train carriage, \(2\) train carriages, \(3\) train carriages …?” or “How many wheels on one car, \(2\) cars, \(3\) cars…?” and recording the results in a diagram or table

- _AC9M2A01_E3_ - recognising the constant term being added or subtracted in an additive pattern and using it to identify missing elements in the sequence

- _AC9M2A01_E4_ - recognising additive patterns in the environment on Country/Place and in First Nations Australians’ material culture; representing them using drawings, coloured counters and numbers
