> locate points in the 4 quadrants of a Cartesian plane; describe changes to the coordinates when a point is moved to a different position in the plane

Elaborations


- _AC9M6SP03_E1_ - understanding that the Cartesian plane provides a graphical or visual way of describing location with respect to a fixed origin

- _AC9M6SP03_E2_ - understanding that the axes are number lines that can have different scales, including fractions and decimals, depending on purpose

- _AC9M6SP03_E3_ - understanding that the horizontal coordinate is written first and is changed if there is a move to the left or right, whereas a move up or down will change the vertical coordinate

- _AC9M6SP03_E4_ - using the Cartesian plane to draw lines and polygons, listing co-ordinates in the correct order to complete a polygon

- _AC9M6SP03_E5_ - investigating and connecting land or star maps used by First Nations Australians with the Cartesian plane through a graphical or visual way of describing location
