> create and interpret grid reference systems using grid references and directions to locate and describe positions and pathways

Elaborations


- _AC9M4SP02_E1_ - interpreting a grid reference map of a familiar location of interest, such as a map of the showgrounds, a food festival, a botanical garden, a park in the local area or a train station, and writing instructions using grid references for a friend to find them at a specified location

- _AC9M4SP02_E2_ - recognising that a spreadsheet uses a grid reference system, locating and entering data in cells and using a spreadsheet to record data collected through observations or experiments

- _AC9M4SP02_E3_ - comparing and contrasting, describing and locating landmarks, people or things in a birdâ€™s eye picture of a busy scene, such as people in a park, initially without a transparent grid reference system overlaid on the picture, and then with the grid overlaid; noticing how the grid helps to pinpoint things quickly and easily

- _AC9M4SP02_E4_ - using different sized grids as a tool to enlarge an image or artwork
