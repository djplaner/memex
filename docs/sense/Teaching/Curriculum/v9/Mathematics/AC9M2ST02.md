> create different graphical representations of data using software where appropriate; compare the different representations, identify and describe common and distinctive features in response to questions

Elaborations


- _AC9M2ST02_E1_ - collecting data from a limited list of choices, creating \(2\) different graphical representations of the data, discussing and comparing the different representations; for example, asking the class to choose their favourite colour from a given set, then co-creating a picture graph with colours on the horizontal axis and comparing to a column graph with colours on the horizontal axis and numbers on the vertical axis

- _AC9M2ST02_E2_ - creating different data displays; for example, lists, tally charts, jointly created column graphs and picture graphs to represent a data set; describing the information that each display represents and discussing how easy or hard they are to interpret and why

- _AC9M2ST02_E3_ - using digital tools to create picture graphs to represent data using one-to-one correspondence, deciding on an appropriate title for the graph and considering whether the categories of data are appropriate for the context

- _AC9M2ST02_E4_ - comparing picture graphs with one-to-one column graphs of the same data, interpreting the data in each and saying how they are the same and how they are different; for example, collecting data on the country of birth of each student and creating different pictographs to represent classroom data

- _AC9M2ST02_E5_ - using dot plots, sticker charts, picture graphs, bar charts and column graphs to represent data
