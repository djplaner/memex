> solve problems involving multiplication of larger numbers by one- or two-digit numbers, choosing efficient calculation strategies and using digital tools where appropriate; check the reasonableness of answers

Elaborations


- _AC9M5N06_E1_ - solving multiplication problems such as \(253 \times 4\) using a doubling strategy; for example, \(2 \times 253 = 506\) and \(2 \times 506 = 1012\)

- _AC9M5N06_E2_ - solving multiplication problems like \(15 \times 16\) by thinking of factors of both numbers, \(15 = 3 \times 5, 16 = 2 \times 8\); rearranging the factors to make the calculation easier, \(5 \times 2 = 10, 3 \times 8 = 24\) and \(10 \times 24 = 240\)

- _AC9M5N06_E3_ - using an array to show place value partitioning to solve multiplication, such as \(324 \times 8\), thinking \(300 \times 8 = 2400, 20 \times 8 = 160, 4 \times 8 = 32\) then adding the parts, \(2400 + 160 + 32 = 2592\) ; connecting the parts of the array to a standard written algorithm

- _AC9M5N06_E4_ - using different strategies used to multiply numbers, explaining how they work and if they have any limitations; for example, discussing how the Japanese visual method for multiplication is not effective for multiplying larger numbers
