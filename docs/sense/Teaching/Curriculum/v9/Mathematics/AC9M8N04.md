> use the 4 operations with integers and with rational numbers, choosing and using efficient strategies and digital tools where appropriate

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M8N04_E1_ - using patterns to assist in establishing the rules for the multiplication and division of integers
	- _AC9M8N04_E2_ - applying and explaining efficient strategies such as using the commutative or associative property for regrouping, partitioning, place value, patterning, multiplication or division facts to solve problems involving positive and negative integers, fractions and decimals
	- _AC9M8N04_E3_ - recognising the effect of sign in the multiplication of integers; for example, (-\(1)^4\;=\;1\) and (-\(1)^5\;=\) -\(1\)
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT803_ - Students solve problems involving the 4 operations with integers and positive rational numbers.
	- _ASMAT804_ - They use mathematical modelling to solve practical problems involving ratios, percentages and rates in measurement and financial contexts.
	- _ASMAT809_ - Students use appropriate metric units when solving measurement problems involving the perimeter and area of composite shapes, and volume of right prisms.
	- _ASMAT811_ - Students use formulas to solve problems involving the area and circumference of circles.
