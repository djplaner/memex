> add and subtract one- and two-digit numbers, representing problems using number sentences, and solve using part-part-whole reasoning and a variety of calculation strategies

Elaborations


- _AC9M2N04_E1_ - using the associative property of addition to assist with mental calculation by partitioning, rearranging and regrouping numbers using number knowledge, near doubles and bridging to \(10\) strategies; for example, calculating \(7 + 8\) using \(7 + (7 + 1) = (7 + 7) + 1\) , the associative property and near doubles; calculating \(7 + 8\) using the associative property and bridging to \(10\) ,  \(7 + (3 + 5) = (7 + 3) + 5\)

- _AC9M2N04_E2_ - using strategies such as doubles, near doubles, part-part-whole knowledge to \(10\), bridging tens and partitioning to mentally solve problems involving two-digit numbers; for example, calculating \(56 + 37\) by thinking \(5\) tens and \(3\) tens is \(8\) tens, \(6 + 7 = 6 + 4 + 3\) is one \(10\) and \(3\), and so the result is \(9\) tens and \(3, 93\)

- _AC9M2N04_E3_ - representing addition and subtraction problems using a bar model and writing a number sentence, explaining how each number in the sentence is connected to the situation

- _AC9M2N04_E4_ - using mental strategies and informal written jottings to help keep track of the numbers when solving addition and subtraction problems involving two-digit numbers and recognising that zero added to a number leaves the number unchanged; for example, in calculating \(34 + 20 = 54, 3\) tens add \(2\) tens is \(5\) tens which is \(50\), and \(4\) ones add zero ones is \(4\) ones which is \(4\), so the result is \(50 + 4 = 54\)

- _AC9M2N04_E5_ - using a physical or mental number line or hundreds chart to solve addition or subtraction problems, by moving along or up and down in tens and ones; for example, “I was given a \(\$100\) gift card for my birthday and spent \(\$38\) on a pair of shoes and \(\$15\) on a t-shirt. How much money do I have left on the card?”

- _AC9M2N04_E6_ - using First Nations Australians’ stories and dances to understand the balance and connection between addition and subtraction, representing relationships as number sentences
