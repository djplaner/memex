> calculate relative frequencies from given or collected data to estimate probabilities of events involving “and”, inclusive “or” and exclusive “or”

Elaborations


- _AC9M9P02_E1_ - understanding that relative frequencies from large data sets or long-run experiments can provide reliable measures of probability and can be used to make predictions of decisions

- _AC9M9P02_E2_ - using Venn diagrams or two-way tables to estimate frequencies of events involving “and”, “or” questions
