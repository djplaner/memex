> calculate relative frequencies from given or collected data to estimate probabilities of events involving “and”, inclusive “or” and exclusive “or”

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M9P02_E1_ - understanding that relative frequencies from large data sets or long-run experiments can provide reliable measures of probability and can be used to make predictions of decisions
	- _AC9M9P02_E2_ - using Venn diagrams or two-way tables to estimate frequencies of events involving “and”, “or” questions
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT919_ - Students assign probabilities to the outcomes of compound events.
	- _ASMAT920_ - They design and conduct experiments or simulations for combined events using digital tools.
