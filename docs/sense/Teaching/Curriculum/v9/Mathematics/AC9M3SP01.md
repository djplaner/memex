> make, compare and classify objects, identifying key features and explaining why these features make them suited to their uses

Elaborations


- _AC9M3SP01_E1_ - classifying a collection of geometric objects, including cylinders, spheres, prisms and pyramids according to key features such as the shape and number of faces and/or surfaces, edges and vertices

- _AC9M3SP01_E2_ - making and comparing objects built out of cubic blocks and discussing key features; for example, comparing the amount of space objects occupy by counting how many blocks it takes to build different rectangular prisms that have the same height but different bases

- _AC9M3SP01_E3_ - making geometric objects in solid form out of connecting cubes, in skeleton form with straws, and constructing objects using dynamic geometric software, recognising, comparing and discussing the features of the objects using the different representations

- _AC9M3SP01_E4_ - using familiar shapes and objects to build or construct models and compare the suitability of different shapes and objects for aspects of the model; for example, building rectangular towers out of connecting cubes and recognising that the taller the tower, the less stable it becomes unless the base is increased; building bridges out of straws bent into different shapes and comparing the strength of different designs

- _AC9M3SP01_E5_ - identifying, classifying and comparing common objects found on Country/Place as cubes, rectangular prisms, cylinders, cones and spheres

- _AC9M3SP01_E6_ - investigating and explaining how First Nations Australiansâ€™ dwellings are oriented in the environment to accommodate climatic conditions
