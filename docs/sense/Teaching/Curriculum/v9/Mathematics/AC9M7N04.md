> find equivalent representations of rational numbers and represent rational numbers on a number line

Elaborations


- _AC9M7N04_E1_ - investigating equivalence of fractions using common multiples and a fraction wall, diagrams or a number line to show that a fraction such as \(\frac23\) is equivalent to \(\frac46\) and \(\frac69\) and therefore \(\frac23\leq\frac56\)

- _AC9M7N04_E2_ - expressing a fraction in simplest form using common divisors

- _AC9M7N04_E3_ - applying and explaining the equivalence between fraction, decimal and percentage representations of rational numbers; for example, \(16\%\), \(0.16\), \(\frac{16}{100}\) and \(\frac4{25}\), using manipulatives, number lines or diagrams

- _AC9M7N04_E4_ - representing positive and negative fractions and mixed numerals on various intervals of the real number line, including intervals that are not symmetrical about zero
