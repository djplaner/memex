> find equivalent representations of rational numbers and represent rational numbers on a number line

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M7N04_E1_ - investigating equivalence of fractions using common multiples and a fraction wall, diagrams or a number line to show that a fraction such as \(\frac23\) is equivalent to \(\frac46\) and \(\frac69\) and therefore \(\frac23\leq\frac56\)
	- _AC9M7N04_E2_ - expressing a fraction in simplest form using common divisors
	- _AC9M7N04_E3_ - applying and explaining the equivalence between fraction, decimal and percentage representations of rational numbers; for example, \(16\%\), \(0.16\), \(\frac{16}{100}\) and \(\frac4{25}\), using manipulatives, number lines or diagrams
	- _AC9M7N04_E4_ - representing positive and negative fractions and mixed numerals on various intervals of the real number line, including intervals that are not symmetrical about zero
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT705_ - Students choose between equivalent representations of rational numbers and percentages to assist in calculations.
	- _ASMAT706_ - They use mathematical modelling to solve practical problems involving rational numbers, percentages and ratios, in financial and other applied contexts, justifying choices of representation.
