> recognise the effect of using approximations of real numbers in repeated calculations and compare the results when using exact representations

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M10N01_E1_ - comparing and contrasting the effect of truncation or rounding on the final result of calculations when using approximations of real numbers rather than exact representations
	- _AC9M10N01_E2_ - investigating the impact of approximation on multiple calculations in contexts that involve the area of compound shapes involving circles, the surface area and volume of compound objects, and repeated calculations of simple interest where the solutions are not exact cents
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT1001_ - By the end of Year 10, students recognise the effect of approximations of real  numbers in repeated calculations.
