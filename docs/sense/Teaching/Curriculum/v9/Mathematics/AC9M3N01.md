Elaborations


- _AC9M3N01_E1_ - moving materials from one place to another on a place value model to show renaming of numbers; for example, \(1574\) can be shown as one thousand, \(5\) hundreds, \(7\) tens and \(4\) ones, or as \(15\) hundreds, \(7\) tens and \(4\) ones

- _AC9M3N01_E2_ - using the repeating pattern of place value names and spaces within sets of \(3\) digits to name and write larger numbers: ones, tens, hundreds, ones of thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, ones of millions, tens of millions; writing, for example, four hundred and twenty-five thousand as \(425 000\)

- _AC9M3N01_E3_ - predicting and naming the number that is one more than \(99, 109, 199, 1009, 1099, 1999, 10 009\) ... \(99 999\) and discussing what will change when one, one ten and one hundred is added to each

- _AC9M3N01_E4_ - comparing the Hindu-Arabic numeral system to other numeral systems; for example, investigating the Japanese numeral system,  一、十、百、千、万

- _AC9M3N01_E5_ - comparing, reading and writing the numbers involved in the more than \(60 000\) years of First Peoples of Australia’s presence on the Australian continent through time scales relating to pre-colonisation and post-colonisation
