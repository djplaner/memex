> analyse claims, inferences and conclusions of statistical reports in the media, including ethical considerations and identification of potential sources of bias

Elaborations


- _AC9M10ST01_E1_ - identifying potentially misleading data representations in the media such as graphs with broken axes and scales that do not start at zero or are nonlinear; recognising when data is not related to the claim, not representative of the population or is deliberately being used to mislead, or support a claim or biased point of view

- _AC9M10ST01_E2_ - investigating the source and size of the sample from which the data was collected and deciding whether the sample is appropriately representative of the population

- _AC9M10ST01_E3_ - investigating population rates and discussing potential ethical considerations when presenting statistical data involving infection rates, and the number of cases per head of population

- _AC9M10ST01_E4_ - using secondary data to predict the number of people likely to be infected with a strain of flu or experience side effects with a certain medication, discussing the ethical considerations of reporting of such data to the wider public, considering validity claims and samples sizes

- _AC9M10ST01_E5_ - using the concept of Indigenous data sovereignty to critique and evaluate the Australian Government’s “Closing the Gap” report
