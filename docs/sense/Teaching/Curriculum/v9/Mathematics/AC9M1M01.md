> compare directly and indirectly and order objects and events using attributes of length, mass, capacity and duration, communicating reasoning

Elaborations


- _AC9M1M01_E1_ - using a piece of string to indirectly compare the length of several objects, deciding which will fit within a space; using comparative language to describe the order: shortest, short, longer, longest

- _AC9M1M01_E2_ - ordering the mass of \(3\) or more objects such as rocks, using hefting and balance scales; using comparative language to explain the order: lightest, light, heavier, heaviest, and how they decided on the order

- _AC9M1M01_E3_ - pouring sand/rice/water from one container to another to compare and order the capacity of \(3\) or more containers; describing the order of the results in terms of which holds the most/least, and those in between

- _AC9M1M01_E4_ - creating sand timers from everyday items or recycled material and comparing them to order the duration of time required for the sand to run through

- _AC9M1M01_E5_ - investigating situations where First Nations Australians estimate, compare and communicate measurements; for example, the duration of seasons; understanding animal behaviour using the length of animal tracks; investigating capacity through water management techniques of First Nations Australians, such as traditional water carrying vessels and rock holes
