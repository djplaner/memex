> use mathematical modelling to solve practical problems involvingÂ proportion and scaling of objects; formulate problems and interpret solutions in terms of the situation; evaluate and modify models as necessary, and report assumptions, methods and findings

Elaborations


- _AC9M10M05_E1_ - using plans and elevation drawings to investigate making changes to building designs, employing appropriate scales and converting to actual measurements within the context to make decisions about changes

- _AC9M10M05_E2_ - analysing and applying scale and ratios in situations such as production prototypes and 3D printing; for example, using a 3D printer to produce scaled versions of actual objects

- _AC9M10M05_E3_ - estimating the scale of an object, such as a toy car, by measuring a linear dimension and using a typical car dimension to work out the scale factor

- _AC9M10M05_E4_ - investigating compliance with building codes and standards in design and construction, such as for escalators in shopping centres
