> use mathematical modelling to solve practical problems involving proportion and scaling of objects; formulate problems and interpret solutions in terms of the situation; evaluate and modify models as necessary, and report assumptions, methods and findings

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M10M05_E1_ - using plans and elevation drawings to investigate making changes to building designs, employing appropriate scales and converting to actual measurements within the context to make decisions about changes
	- _AC9M10M05_E2_ - analysing and applying scale and ratios in situations such as production prototypes and 3D printing; for example, using a 3D printer to produce scaled versions of actual objects
	- _AC9M10M05_E3_ - estimating the scale of an object, such as a toy car, by measuring a linear dimension and using a typical car dimension to work out the scale factor
	- _AC9M10M05_E4_ - investigating compliance with building codes and standards in design and construction, such as for escalators in shopping centres
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT1009_ - Students use mathematical modelling to solve practical problems involving  proportion and scaling, evaluating and modifying models, and reporting assumptions, methods and findings.
