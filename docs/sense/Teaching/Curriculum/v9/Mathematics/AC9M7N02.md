> represent natural numbers as products of powers of prime numbers using exponent notation

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M7N02_E1_ - applying knowledge of factors to strategies for expressing natural numbers as products of powers of prime factors, such as repeated division by prime factors or creating factor trees; for example, \(48=6\times8=2\times3\times2\times2\times2=3^1\times2^4=3\times2^4\)
	- _AC9M7N02_E2_ - developing familiarity with the sequence \(1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512\) and powers of \(2\); the sequence \(1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243, 729\) and powers of \(3\); and the sequence \(1, 5, 25, 125, 625\) and powers of \(5\)
	- _AC9M7N02_E3_ - solving problems involving lowest common multiples and greatest common divisors (highest common factors) for pairs of natural numbers by comparing their prime factorisation
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT701_ - By the end of Year 7, students represent natural numbers in expanded form and as products of prime factors, using exponent notation.
