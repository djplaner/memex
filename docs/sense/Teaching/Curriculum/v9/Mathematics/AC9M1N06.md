> use mathematical modelling to solve practical problems involving equal sharing and grouping; represent the situations with diagrams, physical and virtual materials, and use calculation strategies to solve the problem

Elaborations


- _AC9M1N06_E1_ - modelling problems involving repeated equal group situations, such as, “How many wheels are needed for \(3\) cars?”, using materials and drawing a picture to show what they did, and recording the results with a number

- _AC9M1N06_E2_ - modelling practical problems involving equal sharing situations; for example, sharing a set of dominoes between the \(2\) players in a game, and then counting or subitising to ensure they both have the same number of tiles

- _AC9M1N06_E3_ - modelling money problems involving equal sharing; for example, sorting coins from a money box according to their denominations, sharing the coins equally between \(4\) people, and using counting or subitising to ensure they have equal amounts of each denomination
