> recognise and represent unit fractions including \(\frac12\), \(\frac13\), \(\frac14\), \(\frac15\)  and \(\frac1{10}\) and their multiples in different ways; combine fractions with the same denominator to complete the whole

Elaborations


- _AC9M3N02_E1_ - recognising that unit fractions represent equal parts of a whole; for example, one-third is one of \(3\) equal parts of a whole

- _AC9M3N02_E2_ - representing unit fractions and their multiples in different ways; for example, using a Think Board to represent three-quarters using a diagram, concrete materials, a situation and fraction notation

- _AC9M3N02_E3_ - cutting objects such as oranges, sandwiches or playdough into halves, quarters or fifths and reassembling them to demonstrate; for example, two-halves make a whole, four-quarters make a whole, counting the fractions as they go

- _AC9M3N02_E4_ - sharing collections of objects, such as pop sticks or counters, between \(3, 4\) and \(5\) people and connecting division with fractions; for example, sharing between \(3\) people gives \(\frac13\) of the collection to each and sharing between \(5\) people gives \(\frac15\)  of the collection to each
