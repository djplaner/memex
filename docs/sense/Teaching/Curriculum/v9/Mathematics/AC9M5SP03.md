> describe and perform translations, reflections and rotations of shapes, using dynamic geometric software where appropriate; recognise what changes and what remains the same, and identify any symmetries

Elaborations


- _AC9M5SP03_E1_ - understanding and explaining that translations, rotations and reflections can change the position and orientation of a shape but not the shape or size

- _AC9M5SP03_E2_ - using pattern blocks and paper tracing around a shape and conducting a series of a one-step transformations; continuing to trace each resulting image, then copying the original position and end position on a new sheet of paper

- _AC9M5SP03_E3_ - demonstrating how different combinations of transformations can produce the same resulting image

- _AC9M5SP03_E4_ - challenging classmates to select a combination of transformations to move from an original image to the final image, noting the different combinations by using different colours to trace images

- _AC9M5SP03_E5_ - investigating how animal tracks can be interpreted by First Nations Australians using the transformation of their shapes to help determine and understand animal behaviour
