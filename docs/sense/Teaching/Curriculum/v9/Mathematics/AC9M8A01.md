> create, expand, factorise, rearrange and simplify linear expressions, applying the associative, commutative, identity, distributive and inverse properties

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M8A01_E1_ - rearranging and simplifying linear expressions involving variables with integer coefficients and constants; using manipulatives such as algebra tiles to support calculations; for example, using manipulatives to demonstrate that \(2x+4\;=\;2(x+2),\;3(a-b)=3a -3b\), or \(5(m+2n)+3m-4n\;=\;5m+10n+3m-4n\;=\;8m+6n\)
	- _AC9M8A01_E2_ - demonstrating the relationship between factorising and expanding linear expressions using manipulatives, such as algebra tiles or area models, and describing with mathematical language
	- _AC9M8A01_E3_ - using the distributive, associative, commutative, identity and inverse properties to expand and factorise algebraic expressions using strategies such as the area model
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT805_ - Students apply algebraic properties to rearrange, expand and factorise linear expressions.
	- _ASMAT807_ - Students use mathematical modelling to solve problems using linear relations, interpreting and reviewing the model in context.
