> create, expand, factorise, rearrange and simplify linear expressions, applying the associative, commutative, identity, distributive and inverse properties

Elaborations

- _AC9M8A01_E1_ - rearranging and simplifying linear expressions involving variables with integer coefficients and constants; using manipulatives such as algebra tiles to support calculations; for example, using manipulatives to demonstrate that \(2x+4\;=\;2(x+2),\;3(a-b)=3a -3b\), or \(5(m+2n)+3m-4n\;=\;5m+10n+3m-4n\;=\;8m+6n\)

- _AC9M8A01_E2_ - demonstrating the relationship between factorising and expanding linear expressions using manipulatives, such as algebra tiles or area models, and describing with mathematical language

- _AC9M8A01_E3_ - using the distributive, associative, commutative, identity and inverse properties to expand and factorise algebraic expressions using strategies such as the area model
