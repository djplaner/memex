> construct scatterplots and comment on the association between the 2 numerical variables in terms of strength, direction and linearity

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M10ST03_E1_ - discussing the difference between association and cause and effect, and relating this to situations such as health, diversity of species and climate control
	- _AC9M10ST03_E2_ - using statistical evidence to make, justify and critique claims about association between variables, such as in contexts of climate change, migration, online shopping and social media
	- _AC9M10ST03_E3_ - informally using a line of good fit by eye to discuss reliability of any predictions
	- _AC9M10ST03_E4_ - investigating the relationship between \(2\) variables of spear throwers used by First Peoples of Australia by using data to construct scatterplots, make comparisons and draw conclusions
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT1012_ - They plan and conduct statistical investigations involving bivariate data.
	- _ASMAT1013_ - Students represent the distribution of data involving 2 variables, using tables and scatter plots, and comment on possible association.
	- _ASMAT1015_ - Students compare the distribution of continuous numerical  data  using  various displays, and discuss distributions in terms of centre, spread, shape and outliers.
