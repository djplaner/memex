> compare the parallel cross-sections of objects and recognise their relationships to right prisms

Elaborations


- _AC9M6SP01_E1_ - using objects made of foam or polystyrene, slice along different cross-sections, and record the different shapes of faces that result; comparing cross-sections of different objects

- _AC9M6SP01_E2_ - using different pieces of fruit, slicing across different cross-sections, drawing the cross-section; reporting back to the class the results of the investigation

- _AC9M6SP01_E3_ - observing and drawing the shapes resulting from different ways of slicing through familiar objects; for example, slicing carrots at different angles or cutting through playdough models of objects; using playdough models, fruit or similar to establish which objects can be cut in such a way that the cross-section will always be the same shape

- _AC9M6SP01_E4_ - understanding that right prisms are objects where parallel cross-sections to the base of the prism are the same shape and size

- _AC9M6SP01_E5_ - connecting different right prisms to the shape of their parallel cross-sections, such as a triangular prism which can be described as a stack of the same sized triangles, and a cube or square prism, which can be described as a stack of the same sized squares

- _AC9M6SP01_E6_ - investigating the design of First Nations Australians’ dwellings, exploring the relationship between the cross-sections and the dwellings’ construction
