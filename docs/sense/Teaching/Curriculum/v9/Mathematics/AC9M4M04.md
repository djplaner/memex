> estimate and compare angles using angle names including acute, obtuse, straight angle, reflex and revolution, and recognise their relationship to a right angle

Elaborations


- _AC9M4M04_E1_ - classifying the interior angles of a range of shapes, using examples of angles to identify acute, obtuse, right and reflex angles

- _AC9M4M04_E2_ - identifying angles within the environment and estimating whether they are acute, obtuse right or reflex

- _AC9M4M04_E3_ - creating a right-angle template using cardboard or a double-folded piece of paper and using it to compare angles in the environment, commenting on whether they are smaller than or greater than a right angle

- _AC9M4M04_E4_ - using different measuring tools such as a spirit level or set squares to determine whether lines or objects are straight, square or perpendicular (at right angles)
