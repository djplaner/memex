> measure and compare objects using familiar metric units of length, mass and capacity, and instruments with labelled markings

Elaborations


- _AC9M3M02_E1_ - making a measuring tape using metric units of length and using it to measure and compare things; for example, the girth of a tree; explaining that the lines on a ruler show the beginning and end of each unit

- _AC9M3M02_E2_ - using a strip of centimetre grid paper to measure and compare the length of objects, connecting this with centimetre units on a ruler and using fractions of a graduation to give a more accurate measure

- _AC9M3M02_E3_ - discussing how the capacity of a container or object usually refers to the amount of liquid it can hold, measured in millilitres and litres; comparing the capacity of different sizes of familiar drinks; for example, \(600\) millilitres, one litre, \(2\) litre and \(3\) litre milk containers

- _AC9M3M02_E4_ - measuring and comparing the mass of objects and capacity of containers, using measuring jugs and kitchen or other scales and standard metric units of millilitres, litres, grams and kilograms; interpreting and explaining what the lines on the measuring jug or scales mean

- _AC9M3M02_E5_ - comparing the capacity of different beakers used in science lessons and using the numbered graduations to measure out different capacities of liquid
