> use mathematical modelling to solve applied problems  involving linear relations, including financial contexts; formulate problems with linear functions, choosing a representation; interpret and communicate solutions in terms of the situation, reviewing the appropriateness of the model

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M8A03_E1_ - modelling situations involving linear functions, including practical contexts such as taxi fares involving flag fall fees, motion in a straight line at a constant speed, trade quotes involving call out fees, cooking that includes resting or cooling times, or water leakage from water tanks, interpreting the constant rate of change and initial value in context, and identifying when values of a model lie within a given range
	- _AC9M8A03_E2_ - modelling problems in practical situations and interpreting solutions within the context of the problem, including giving attention to all units of measure and whether results are suitable; for example, once a water tank is empty no more water can flow from it
	- _AC9M8A03_E3_ - modelling financial problems involving pay rates, using a table of values to represent the pay amounts and hours worked using an hourly rate of pay, and graphing the relationship to make inferences
	- _AC9M8A03_E4_ - modelling patterns on Country/Place and exploring their connections and meaning to linear equations, using the model as a predictive tool and critiquing results by connecting back to Country/Place
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT807_ - Students use mathematical modelling to solve problems using linear relations, interpreting and reviewing the model in context.
