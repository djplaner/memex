> investigate techniques for data collection including census, sampling, experiment and observation, and explain the practicalities and implications of obtaining data through these techniques

Elaborations


- _AC9M8ST01_E1_ - identifying situations where data can be collected by census and those where a sample is appropriate

- _AC9M8ST01_E2_ - investigating the practicalities and implications of obtaining data through sampling, using a variety of investigative processes; for example, investigating situations when random sampling or non-random sampling  is used to collect data and the implication of each sampling method

- _AC9M8ST01_E3_ - discussing how observations, experiments and sampling methods can be impacted by bias; for example, recognising that a sampling bias occurs when certain members of a population are more likely to be selected in a sample than others, such as a survey conducted at a shopping centre; recognising that environmental conditions may bias the results of scientific investigations if experiments are conducted at different times or under different conditions

- _AC9M8ST01_E4_ - using digital tools such as simulations and digital measuring devices to observe, measure and record qualitative and quantitative data, discussing precision and the implications of error
