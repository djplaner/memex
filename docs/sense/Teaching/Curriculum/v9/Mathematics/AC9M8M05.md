> recognise and use rates to solve problems involving the comparison of 2 related quantities of different units of measure

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M8M05_E1_ - identifying examples of rates in the real world, including constant rates, rate of pay, cost per kilogram, recipes, simple interest and average rates
	- _AC9M8M05_E2_ - applying rates to solve problems involving the conversion between different units of measure; for example, using a conversion rate to convert distances from miles into kilometres; using currency exchange rates to determine the price of items
	- _AC9M8M05_E3_ - applying rates to calculate solutions to problems in different contexts; for example, required run rates in cricket, dilution of concentrated chemicals and comparing the petrol consumption rates of different vehicles
	- _AC9M8M05_E4_ - using taxation tables to calculate an individual's annual income tax
	- _AC9M8M05_E5_ - investigating the application of rates in First Nation Australiansâ€™ land management practices, including the rate of fire spread under different environmental conditions such as fuel types, wind speed, temperature and relative humidity; the conservation of water by First Nations Australians by estimating rates of water evaporation based on surface area and climatic conditions
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT804_ - They use mathematical modelling to solve practical problems involving ratios, percentages and rates in measurement and financial contexts.
