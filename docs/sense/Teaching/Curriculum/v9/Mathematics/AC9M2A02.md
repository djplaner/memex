> recall and demonstrate proficiency with addition facts to 20; extend and apply facts to develop related subtraction facts

Elaborations


- _AC9M2A02_E1_ - using ten-frames or materials such as connecting cubes to develop and record addition and subtraction strategies including doubles, near doubles, counting on, combinations to \(10\) and bridging to \(10\), explaining patterns and connections noticed within the facts

- _AC9M2A02_E2_ - partitioning and rearranging collections to practice and develop fluency with addition and subtraction facts to \(20\) leading to the recall of these facts; for example, partitioning using materials and part-part-whole diagrams to develop subtraction facts related to addition facts, such as \(8 + 7 = 15\) therefore, \(15\space – \space7 = 8\) and \(15 \space– \space8 = 7\)

- _AC9M2A02_E3_ - using partitioning to develop and record facts systematically; for example, “How many ways can \(10\) birds be spread among \(2\) trees?”, \(10 = 10 + 0\), \(10 = 9 + 1\), \(10 = 8 + 2\), \(10 = 7 + 3\), …; explaining how they know they have found all possible partitions
