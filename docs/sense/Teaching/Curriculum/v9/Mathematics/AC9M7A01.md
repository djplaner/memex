> recognise and use variables to represent everyday formulas algebraically and substitute values into formulas to determine an unknown

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M7A01_E1_ - linking variables to attributes and measures being modelled when using formulas, such as the area of a rectangle is equal to the length x width as \(A\;=\;l\;\times\;w\) or using \(p\;=\;6g\;+\;b\) to describe a total of points expressed as goals (worth \(6\) points) and behinds (worth one point)
	- _AC9M7A01_E2_ - interpreting and using formulas obtained from other sources; for example, maximum heart rates and target heart rates for moderate exercise
	- _AC9M7A01_E3_ - substituting numerical values for variables when using formulas and calculating the value of an unknown in practical situations; for example, calculating weekly wage \(W\) given base wage \(b\) and overtime hours \(h\) at \(1.5\) times rate \(r\), \(W\;=\;b+1.5\times h\times r\), using values for mass \(m\) and volume \(v\) to determine density \(d\) of a substance where \(d\;=\;\frac mv\)
	- _AC9M7A01_E4_ - using everyday formulas and their application to contexts on Country/Place, investigating the relationships between variables
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT707_ - Students use algebraic expressions to represent situations, describe the relationships between variables from authentic data  and substitute values into formulas to determine unknown values.
	- _ASMAT711_ - Students use formulas for the areas of triangles and parallelograms and the volumes of rectangular and triangular prisms to solve problems.
