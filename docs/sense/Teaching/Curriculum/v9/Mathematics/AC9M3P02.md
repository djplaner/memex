> conduct repeated chance experiments; identify and describe possible outcomes, record the results, recognise and discuss the variation

Elaborations


- _AC9M3P02_E1_ - identifying the possible outcomes of a chance experiment, creating a tally chart to record results, carrying out a few trials and tallying the results for each trial; responding to the questions: “How did your results vary for each trial?” and “How do the results vary across the class?”

- _AC9M3P02_E2_ - conducting repeated trials of chance experiments such as tossing a coin, throwing a dice, drawing a coloured or numbered ball from a bag, using a coloured spinner with equal partitions, and identifying the variation in the number of heads/fives/reds between trials
