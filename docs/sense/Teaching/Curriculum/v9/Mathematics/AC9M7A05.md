> generate tables of values from visually growing patterns or the rule of a function; describe and plot these relationships on the Cartesian plane

Elaborations


- _AC9M7A05_E1_ - plotting points from a table of values generated using simple linear functions and recognising patterns, such as the points lie on a straight line

- _AC9M7A05_E2_ - discussing and using variables to create a general rule and use the rule to determine the value of the dependent variable for any given value of the independent variable; for example, plotting the value of the circumference of a circle for varying values of radius

- _AC9M7A05_E3_ - using function machines to generate a table of ordered pairs using input and output values, plotting the relationships on a Cartesian plane and describing the graph in terms of shape

- _AC9M7A05_E4_ - using diagrams and manipulatives to form linear growth patterns, representing these patterns in tables and describing the relationship in terms of the way the pattern is growing and in the context of the situation
