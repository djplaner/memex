Elaborations


- _AC9M3N04_E1_ - applying knowledge of numbers and the properties of operations using a variety of ways to represent multiplication or division number sentences; for example, using a Think Board to show different ways of visualising \(8 \times 4\), such as an array, a diagram and as a worded problem

- _AC9M3N04_E2_ - using part-part-whole and comparative models to visually represent multiplicative relationships and choosing whether to use multiplication or division to solve problems

- _AC9M3N04_E3_ - matching or creating a problem scenario or story that can be represented by a given number sentence involving multiplication and division; for example, using given number sentences to create worded problems for others to solve

- _AC9M3N04_E4_ - formulating connected multiplication and division expressions by representing situations from First Nations Australiansâ€™ cultural stories and dances about how they care for Country/Place such as turtle egg gathering using number sentences
