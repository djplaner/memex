> solve linear inequalities and simultaneous linear equations in 2 variables; interpret solutions graphically and communicate solutions in terms of the situation

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M10A02_E1_ - investigating situations involving linear equations in context, such as multiple quotes for a job, or profit and loss; solving the equations graphically, giving solutions in everyday language, such as “break-even point” or “point to change providers” for the job
	- _AC9M10A02_E2_ - describing the solution of simultaneous equations within the context of the situation
	- _AC9M10A02_E3_ - graphing regions corresponding to inequalities in the Cartesian plane; for example, graphing \(2x+3y<24\) and verifying using a test point such as (\(0, 0\))
	- _AC9M10A02_E4_ - identifying all the combinations of trips to the movies, each costing \(\$12\), and ice-skating sessions, each costing \(\$21\), as the integer solutions for an entertainment budget of up to \(\$150\) for the school holidays; expressing algebraically as \(12m+21s\leq150\)
	- _AC9M10A02_E5_ - testing when a circle of a specified radius has a corresponding area greater than a given value, or whether a point satisfies an inequality; for example, whether the point (\(3, 5\)) satisfies \(2y<x^2\)
	- _AC9M10A02_E6_ - investigating the strategies inherent in First Nations Australian children’s instructive games; for example, Weme from the Warlpiri Peoples of central Australia, and their connection to strategies to solve simultaneous linear equations in \(2\) variables
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT1004_ - They solve problems involving simultaneous linear equations and linear inequalities in 2 variables graphically and justify solutions.
