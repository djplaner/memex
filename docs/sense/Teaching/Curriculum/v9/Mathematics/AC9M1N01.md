Elaborations


- _AC9M1N01_E1_ - reading, writing and naming numerals and ordering two-digit numbers from zero to at least \(120\), using patterns within the natural number system, including numbers that look and sound similar; for example, \(16, 60, 61\) and \(66\)

- _AC9M1N01_E2_ - using number tracks or positioning a set of numbered cards in the correct order and relative location by pegging on an empty number line

- _AC9M1N01_E3_ - using hundreds charts to build understanding and fluency with numbers; for example, collaboratively building a hundreds chart using cards numbered from zero to \(99\); colour code the count of tens in a hundreds chart using one colour to represent the number of tens and another to represent the number of ones

- _AC9M1N01_E4_ - recognising that numbers are used in all languages and cultures but may be represented differently in words and symbols; for example, through kanji numbers in Japanese and characters in Chinese, and that there are alternate numeration systems; for example, using special characters for \(10\) and \(100\) and other multiples of \(10\) in Japanese and Chinese numeration
