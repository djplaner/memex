> approximate numerical solutions to problems involving rational numbers and percentages, including financial contexts, using appropriate estimation strategies

Elaborations


- _AC9M6N08_E1_ - using familiar fractions, decimals and percentages to approximate calculations, such as, \(0.3\) of \(180\) is about a \(\frac13\) of \(180\) or \(52\)% is about a \(\frac12\)

- _AC9M6N08_E2_ - choosing appropriate estimation strategies including rounding to the nearest whole number, knowledge of multiples of \(2, 5\) or \(10\) and partitioning numbers in contexts such as measuring or cost per unit

- _AC9M6N08_E3_ - recognising the effect of rounding on calculations involving fractions or decimals and saying what numbers the answer will be between

- _AC9M6N08_E4_ - recognising the usefulness of estimation to check calculations for contexts such as dividing wood into a number of lengths, calculating cost per unit, reducing a recipe or dividing the cost of dinner for a group into individual amounts

- _AC9M6N08_E5_ - verifying solutions by estimating percentages in suitable contexts such as discounts using common percentages of \(10\)%, \(25\)%, \(30\)%, \(50\)% and \(1\)%

- _AC9M6N08_E6_ - investigating estimation strategies to make decisions about steam cooking in ground ovens by First Nations Australians, including catering for different numbers of people and resources needed for cooking
