> recognise terminating and recurring decimals, using digital tools as appropriate

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M8N03_E1_ - identifying when a fraction has a terminating decimal expansion from the prime factorisation of its denominator; for example, \(\frac7{24}\;=\;0.291\overset\_6\) does not have a terminating decimal expansion, while \(\frac7{25}\;=\;0.28\) does
	- _AC9M8N03_E2_ - identifying terminating, recurring and non-terminating decimals and choosing their appropriate representations such as \(\frac13\) is represented as \(0.\overset\_3\)
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT801_ - By the end of Year 8, students recognise irrational numbers and terminating or recurring decimals.
