> represent the distribution of multiple data sets for numerical variables using comparative representations; compare data distributions with consideration of centre, spread and shape, and the effect of outliers on these measures

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M9ST03_E1_ - describing the shape of the distribution of data using terms such as “positive skew”, “negative skew” and “symmetric” and “bi-modal”
	- _AC9M9ST03_E2_ - using stem-and-leaf plots to compare \(2\) like sets of data such as the heights of girls and the heights of boys in a class
	- _AC9M9ST03_E3_ - constructing grouped histograms that show trends in health issues such as lung cancer, leukemia, stroke and diabetes, and using the graph to justify, verify or invalidate claims
	- _AC9M9ST03_E4_ - exploring comparative data presented in reports by National Indigenous Australians Agency in regard to “Closing the Gap”, discussing the comparative distributions within the context of the data; for example, comparative data presented in the “Closing the Gap – Prime Minister’s Report”
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT916_ - They compare and analyse the distributions of multiple numerical data sets, choose representations, describe features of these data sets using summary statistics and the shape of distributions, and consider the effect of outliers.
