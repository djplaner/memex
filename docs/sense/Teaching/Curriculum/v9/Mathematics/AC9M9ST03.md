> represent the distribution of multiple data sets for numerical variables using comparative representations; compare data distributions with consideration of centre, spread and shape, and the effect of outliers on these measures

Elaborations


- _AC9M9ST03_E1_ - describing the shape of the distribution of data using terms such as “positive skew”, “negative skew” and “symmetric” and “bi-modal”

- _AC9M9ST03_E2_ - using stem-and-leaf plots to compare \(2\) like sets of data such as the heights of girls and the heights of boys in a class

- _AC9M9ST03_E3_ - constructing grouped histograms that show trends in health issues such as lung cancer, leukemia, stroke and diabetes, and using the graph to justify, verify or invalidate claims

- _AC9M9ST03_E4_ - exploring comparative data presented in reports by National Indigenous Australians Agency in regard to “Closing the Gap”, discussing the comparative distributions within the context of the data; for example, comparative data presented in the “Closing the Gap – Prime Minister’s Report”
