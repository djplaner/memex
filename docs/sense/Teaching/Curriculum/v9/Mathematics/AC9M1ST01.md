Elaborations


- _AC9M1ST01_E1_ - discussing methods of collecting data to answer a question, such as “What types of rubbish are found in the playground?”, sharing ideas and trying out some of the suggested methods; reviewing the data collected and explaining how they might change the way they collect data next time

- _AC9M1ST01_E2_ - collecting and recording information on a topic of interest using lists; for example, “how many people follow a particular football team” or “what colour eyes each person has”; examining the data, to generate some questions that it could answer, then rearranging the data or collecting different data to answer the question

- _AC9M1ST01_E3_ - creating a tally to record data while observing events such as the year level of students using the bike shed; deciding on the possible categories before the observations are taken, then reviewing the data afterwards to notice whether the tally was effective

- _AC9M1ST01_E4_ - using star charts with stickers or emojis to represent class data; for example, using emojis on a personal feeling chart to represent how they are feeling each day or using emojis to represent activities on the class calendar
