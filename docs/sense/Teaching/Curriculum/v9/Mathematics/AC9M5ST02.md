Elaborations


- _AC9M5ST02_E1_ - reading and interpreting different line graphs, discussing how the horizontal axis represents measures of time such as days of the week or times of the day, and the vertical axis represents numerical quantities or ordinal categorical variables such as percentages, money, measurements or ratings such as fire hazard ratings

- _AC9M5ST02_E2_ - interpreting real-life data represented as a line graph showing how measurements change over a period of time and make simple inferences

- _AC9M5ST02_E3_ - matching unlabelled line graphs to the context they represent based on the stories of the different contexts

- _AC9M5ST02_E4_ - interpreting the data represented in a line graph making inferences; for example, reading line graphs that show the varying temperatures or UV rates over a period of a day and discussing when would be the best time to hold an outdoor assembly
