> design and conductâ€¯repeated chance experiments and simulations using digital tools to model conditional probability and interpret results

Elaborations


- _AC9M10P02_E1_ - using samples of different sizes with and without replacement from a population to identify when the difference in methods becomes negligible

- _AC9M10P02_E2_ - recognising that an event can be dependent on another event and that this will affect the way its probability is calculated

- _AC9M10P02_E3_ - using simulations to gather data on frequencies for situations involving chance that appear to be counter-intuitive, such as the three-door problem or the birthday problem

- _AC9M10P02_E4_ - identifying situations in real-life where probability simulations are used for decision-making, such as supply and demand of product, insurance risk and queueing

- _AC9M10P02_E5_ - using simulation to predict the number of people likely to be infected with a strain of flu or virus
