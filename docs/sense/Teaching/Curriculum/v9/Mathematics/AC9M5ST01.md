> acquire, validate and represent data for nominal and ordinal categorical and discrete numerical variables, to address a question of interest or purpose using software including spreadsheets; discuss and report on data distributions in terms of highest frequency (mode) and shape, in the context of the data

Elaborations


- _AC9M5ST01_E1_ - recognising that ordinal data is a form of categorical data even though the data being collected might be numbers; for example, a rating scale using numbers \(1 – 5\) to represent the categories people can choose from when asked, “What rating would you give this film out of \(5\)?”

- _AC9M5ST01_E2_ - determining the mode for a set of data and discussing that there may be more than one mode

- _AC9M5ST01_E3_ - identifying the best methods of presenting data to illustrate the results of investigations and justifying the choice of representations

- _AC9M5ST01_E4_ - acquiring data through chance experiments, discussing and reporting on the distribution of outcomes and how this relates to equal and unequal outcomes

- _AC9M5ST01_E5_ - using digital systems to validate data; for example, recognising the difference between numerical, text and date formats in spreadsheets; setting data types in a spreadsheet to make sure a date is input correctly

- _AC9M5ST01_E6_ - investigating data relating to Australia’s reconciliation process with First Nations Australians, posing questions, discussing and reporting on findings
