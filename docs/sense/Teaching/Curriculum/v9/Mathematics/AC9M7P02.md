> conduct repeated chance experiments and run simulations with a large number of trials using digital tools; compare predictions about outcomes with observed results, explaining the differences

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M7P02_E1_ - developing an understanding of the law of large numbers through using experiments and simulations to conduct large numbers of trials for seemingly random events and discussing findings
	- _AC9M7P02_E2_ - conducting simulations using online simulation tools and comparing the combined results of a large number of trials to predicted results
	- _AC9M7P02_E3_ - exploring and observing First Nations Australian children’s instructive games; for example, Koara from the Jawi and Bardi Peoples of Sunday Island in Western Australia, to investigate probability, predicting outcomes for an event and comparing with increasingly larger numbers of trials, and between observed and expected results
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT720_ - They conduct repeated single-step chance experiments and run simulations using digital tools, giving reasons for differences between predicted and observed results.
