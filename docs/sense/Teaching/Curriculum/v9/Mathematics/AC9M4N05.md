> solve problems involving multiplying or dividing natural numbers by multiples and powers of 10 without a calculator, using the multiplicative relationship between the place value of digits

Elaborations


- _AC9M4N05_E1_ - using physical or virtual materials to demonstrate the multiplicative relationship between the places

- _AC9M4N05_E2_ - using materials such as place value charts, numeral expanders or sliders to recognise and explain why multiplying by \(10\) moves the digits one place to the left and dividing by \(10\) moves digits one place to the right

- _AC9M4N05_E3_ - using a calculator or other digital tools to recognise and develop an understanding of the effect of multiplying or dividing numbers by \(10\)s, \(100\)s and \(1000\)s, recording sequences in a place value chart, in a table or spreadsheet, generalising the patterns noticed and applying  them to solve multiplicative problems without a calculator
