> use mathematical modelling to solve practical problems involving rational numbers and percentages, including financial contexts; formulate problems, choosing efficient calculation strategies and using digital tools where appropriate; interpret and communicate solutions in terms of the situation, reviewing the appropriateness of the model

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M8N05_E1_ - modelling situations involving weather and environmental contexts including temperature or sea depths by applying operations to positive and negative rational numbers; for example, involving average temperature increases and decreases
	- _AC9M8N05_E2_ - modelling situations that involve percentage increases or decreases and explaining why it is an increase or decrease, such as mark-ups, discounts, Goods and Services Tax, changes in populations or recycling rates
	- _AC9M8N05_E3_ - modelling situations involving personal income tax, interpreting tax tables to determine income tax at various levels of income, including overall percentage of income allocated to tax
	- _AC9M8N05_E4_ - modelling situations involving percentage increase or decrease such as market trends, effects on population, or effects on the environment over extended time periods
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT804_ - They use mathematical modelling to solve practical problems involving ratios, percentages and rates in measurement and financial contexts.
