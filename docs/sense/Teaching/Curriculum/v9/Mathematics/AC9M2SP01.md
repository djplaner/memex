> recognise, compare and classify shapes, referencing the number of sides and using spatial terms such as “opposite”, “parallel”, “curved” and “straight”

Elaborations


- _AC9M2SP01_E1_ - sorting a collection of shapes in different ways based on their features such as number of sides, whether all sides are equal, whether pairs of opposite sides are parallel; for example, collections of triangles and other polygons

- _AC9M2SP01_E2_ - manipulating shapes and recognising that different orientations do not change the shape; for example, cutting out pictures of various shapes, recognising they are they are still classified as the same shape even if they are upside down or on their side

- _AC9M2SP01_E3_ - investigating the shapes of different sporting fields, describing and labelling their features including side lines, centre circles and goal squares; for example, labelling the lines on a basketball court and using spatial terms to describe them

- _AC9M2SP01_E4_ - creating regular shapes using digital tools, describing and observing what happens when you manipulate them; for example, dragging or pushing vertices to produce irregular shapes, moving or rotating a shape
