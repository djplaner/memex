> recall and demonstrate proficiency with multiplication facts for twos; extend and apply facts to develop the related division facts using doubling and halving 

Elaborations


- _AC9M2A03_E1_ - recognising and relating terms such as double, twice and multiply by \(2\), halve and divide by \(2\) using physical and virtual materials; for example, colouring numbers on a hundreds chart to represent doubles and use to recognise halves; recognising the doubling pattern and applying to find related facts such as for \(8\) twos think \(2\) eights

- _AC9M2A03_E2_ - doubling and halving collections to practise and develop fluency with multiplication and division facts for twos leading to recall of these facts

- _AC9M2A03_E3_ - establishing an understanding of doubles and near doubles using physical or virtual manipulatives; for example, using manipulatives to establish that doubling \(5\) gives you \(10\) then extending this doubling fact to respond to the question, “How can you use this fact to double \(6\) or double \(4\)?”

- _AC9M2A03_E4_ - develop fluency with doubling and halving numbers within \(20\) using physical or virtual materials and playing doubling and halving games; for example, using a physical or virtual dice and choosing whether to double or halve to reach a target number
