> recognise that 100% represents the complete whole and use percentages to describe, represent and compare relative size; connect familiar percentages to their decimal and fraction equivalents

Elaborations


- _AC9M5N04_E1_ - recognising applications of percentages used in everyday contexts; for example, the bar model used for charging devices indicating the percentage of power remaining; advertising in retail contexts relating to discounts or sales

- _AC9M5N04_E2_ - creating a model by subdividing a whole; for example, using \(10\) x \(10\) grids to represent various percentage amounts and recognising complementary percentages, such as \(30\)% and \(70\)% combine to make \(100\)%

- _AC9M5N04_E3_ - creating a model by subdividing a collection of materials, such as blocks or money, to connect decimals and percentage equivalents of tenths and commonly used fractions \(\frac12\), \(\frac14\) and \(\frac34\); for example, one-tenth or \(0.1\) represents \(10\)% and one half or \(0.5\) represents \(50\)%; recognising that \(60\)% is \(10\)% more than \(50\)%

- _AC9M5N04_E4_ - using physical and virtual materials to represent the relationship between decimal notation and percentages; for example, \(0.3\) is \(3\) out of every \(10\), which is \(30\) out of every \(100\), which is \(30\)%)
