> list the possible outcomes of chance experiments involving equally likely outcomes and compare to those which are not equally likely

Elaborations


- _AC9M5P01_E1_ - discussing what it means for outcomes to be equally likely and comparing the number of possible and equally likely outcomes of chance events; for example, when drawing a card from a standard deck of cards there are \(4\) possible outcomes if you are interested in the suit, \(2\) possible outcomes if you are interested in the colour or \(52\) outcomes if you are interested in the exact card

- _AC9M5P01_E2_ - discussing how chance experiments that have equally likely outcomes can be referred to as random chance events; for example, if all the names of students in a class are placed in a hat and one is drawn at random, each person has an equally likely chance of being drawn

- _AC9M5P01_E3_ - commenting on the chance of winning games by considering the number of possible outcomes and the consequent chance of winning

- _AC9M5P01_E4_ - investigating why some games are fair and others are not; for example, drawing a track game to resemble a running race and taking it in turns to roll \(2\) dice, where the first runner moves a square if the difference between the \(2\) dice is zero, one or \(2\) and the second runner moves a square if the difference is \(3, 4\) or \(5\); responding to the questions, “Is this game fair?”, “Are some differences more likely to come up than others?” and “How can you work that out?”

- _AC9M5P01_E5_ - comparing the chance of a head or a tail when a coin is tossed, whether some numbers on a dice are more likely to be facing up when the dice is rolled, or the chance of getting a \(1, 2\) or \(3\) on a spinner with uneven regions for the numbers

- _AC9M5P01_E6_ - discussing supermarket promotions such as collecting stickers or objects and whether there is an equal chance of getting each of them
