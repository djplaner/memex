> recognise that probabilities lie on numerical scales of 0 – 1 or 0% – 100% and use estimation to assign probabilities that events occur in a given context, using common fractions, percentages and decimals

Elaborations


- _AC9M6P01_E1_ - recognising that the probability of an event occurring can be represented numerically as either a number ranging from zero to one or a percentage from \(0\)% to \(100\)% where zero or \(0\)% means it won’t happen and one or \(100\)% means it is certain to happen

- _AC9M6P01_E2_ - using a scale of zero to one or \(0\)% to \(100\)% to estimate chances of events

- _AC9M6P01_E3_ - listing the different possible outcomes for rolling a dice and using a scale to locate the relative probability by considering the chance of more or less than for each possible event; for example, the probability of getting a number greater than \(4\)

- _AC9M6P01_E4_ - recognising the language used to describe situations involving uncertainty, such as what it means to be lucky, a \(75\)% chance of rain or a \(1\)-in-\(100\) years flood

- _AC9M6P01_E5_ - exploring First Nations Australian children’s instructive games, such as Weme from the Warlpiri Peoples of Central Australia, to investigate and assign probabilities that events will occur, indicating their estimated likelihood
