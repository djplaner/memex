> graph linear relations on the Cartesian plane using digital tools where appropriate; solve linear equations and one-variable inequalities using graphical and algebraic techniques; verify solutions by substitution

Elaborations


- _AC9M8A02_E1_ - recognising that in a table of values, if the first difference between consecutive values of the dependent variable is constant, then it is a linear relation

- _AC9M8A02_E2_ - graphing linear functions and relations of the form \(x\;=\;a,\;y\;=\;a,\;x\;\leq\;a,\;x\;>\;a,\;y\leq\;a,\;y>\;a\) on the Cartesian plane for known values of \(a\)

- _AC9M8A02_E3_ - completing a table of values, plotting the resulting points on the Cartesian plane and determining whether the relationship is linear

- _AC9M8A02_E4_ - graphing the linear relationship \(ax+b\;=\;c\)  for given values of \(a\), \(b\) and \(c\) and identifying from the graph where \(ax+b\;<\;c\) or where  \(ax+b\;>\;c\)

- _AC9M8A02_E5_ - solving linear equations of the form \(ax+b\;=\;c\) and one-variable inequalities of the form \(ax+b\;<\;c\) or \(ax+b\;>\;c\) where \(a>0\) using inverse operations and digital tools, and checking solutions by substitution

- _AC9M8A02_E6_ - solving linear equations such as \(3x+7\;=\;6x-9\), representing these graphically, and verifying solutions by substitution
