> formulate algebraic expressions using constants, variables, operations and brackets

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M7A02_E1_ - generalising arithmetic expressions to algebraic expressions involving constants, variables, operations and brackets; for example, \(7+7+7=3\times7,\;x+x+x=3\times x\) noting that \(3x\) includes implied multiplication and recognising the difference between \(3x+4\) and \(3(x+4)\)
	- _AC9M7A02_E2_ - formulating algebraic expressions that represent mathematical relationships; for example, translating from words to symbols, “think of a number” type of activities
	- _AC9M7A02_E3_ - recognising and applying the concept of variable as something that can change in value, investigating the relationships between variables, and the application to processes on Country/Place, including how cultural expressions of First Nations Australians, such as storytelling, communicate mathematical relationships that can be represented as mathematical expressions
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT707_ - Students use algebraic expressions to represent situations, describe the relationships between variables from authentic data  and substitute values into formulas to determine unknown values.
