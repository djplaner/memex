> measure and compare objects based on length, capacity and mass using appropriate uniform informal units and smaller units for accuracy when necessary

Elaborations


- _AC9M2M01_E1_ - choosing suitable informal units to measure the length of a range of objects; justifying their choice of a longer unit to measure things that are long, such as the width of a room, and a shorter unit to measure shorter things or when more accuracy is needed

- _AC9M2M01_E2_ - comparing the capacity of several containers using sand and units such as a spoon or cup, to say which container will hold the most and how much more it will hold; recording the results, writing an explanation of their measurement process, including using smaller units to be more accurate, and justifying the result

- _AC9M2M01_E3_ - using balance scales to compare the mass of several objects, selecting an appropriate informal unit; counting the number of informal units to determine which object is heavier and how much heavier; explaining why the informal units chosen need to be the same mass

- _AC9M2M01_E4_ - recognising that the same informal unit needs to be used when measuring; for example, demonstrating and discussing why using different shoe lengths to measure the same distance could result in the measures being different; discussing why a smaller sized informal unit may result in a larger number of units compared to a larger informal unit

- _AC9M2M01_E5_ - investigating First Nations Australiansâ€™ use of body parts, such as hands, as uniform informal units of measurement used to measure and compare objects; for example, in the manufacturing of nets for a particular purpose

- _AC9M2M01_E6_ - investigating and comparing measurable attributes that are interpreted by First Nations Australians to understand animal behaviour such as the length, width and depth of animal tracks
