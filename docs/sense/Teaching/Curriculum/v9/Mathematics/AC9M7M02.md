> solve problems involving the volume of right prisms including rectangular and triangular prisms, using established formulas and appropriate units

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M7M02_E1_ - building a rectangular prism out of unit cubes and showing that the measure of volume is the same as would be found by multiplying the \(3\) edge lengths or by multiplying the area of the base by the height/length
	- _AC9M7M02_E2_ - developing the connection between the area of the parallel cross-section (base), the height and volume of a rectangular or triangular prism to other prisms
	- _AC9M7M02_E3_ - connecting the area of the floor space and the number of floors of a high-rise building to calculate the volume of a building
	- _AC9M7M02_E4_ - using dynamic geometry software, spatial reasoning and prediction to derive the formula for the volume of prisms
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT711_ - Students use formulas for the areas of triangles and parallelograms and the volumes of rectangular and triangular prisms to solve problems.
