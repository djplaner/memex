> design and conduct repeated chance experiments and simulations, using digital tools to compare probabilities of simple events to related compound events, and describe results

Elaborations


- _AC9M9P03_E1_ - using digital tools to conduct probability simulations that demonstrate the relationship between the probability of compound events and the individual probabilities

- _AC9M9P03_E2_ - comparing experiments which differ only by being undertaken with replacement or without replacement

- _AC9M9P03_E3_ - conducting two-step chance experiments using systematic methods to list outcomes of experiments and to list outcomes favourable to an event

- _AC9M9P03_E4_ - using repeated trials of First Nations Australian childrenâ€™s instructive games; for example, Gorri from all parts of Australia, to calculate the probabilities of winning and not winning
