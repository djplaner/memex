> design and conduct repeated chance experiments and simulations, using digital tools to compare probabilities of simple events to related compound events, and describe results

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M9P03_E1_ - using digital tools to conduct probability simulations that demonstrate the relationship between the probability of compound events and the individual probabilities
	- _AC9M9P03_E2_ - comparing experiments which differ only by being undertaken with replacement or without replacement
	- _AC9M9P03_E3_ - conducting two-step chance experiments using systematic methods to list outcomes of experiments and to list outcomes favourable to an event
	- _AC9M9P03_E4_ - using repeated trials of First Nations Australian childrenâ€™s instructive games; for example, Gorri from all parts of Australia, to calculate the probabilities of winning and not winning
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT920_ - They design and conduct experiments or simulations for combined events using digital tools.
