> acquire data sets for discrete and continuous numerical variables and calculate the range, median, mean and mode; make and justify decisions about which measures of central tendency provide useful insights into the nature of the distribution of data

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M7ST01_E1_ - understanding that summarising data by calculating measures of centre can help make sense of the data, commenting on skewness or symmetry of data and the use of mean and median as representative measures
	- _AC9M7ST01_E2_ - comparing the mean, median, mode and range of displays of data from a given context, and explaining how outliers may affect summary statistics
	- _AC9M7ST01_E3_ - recognising how different data sets can have the same measures of central tendency and experimenting with how varying data affects these measures
	- _AC9M7ST01_E4_ - acquire continuous numerical data by taking measurement samples during a science experiment, observation or field study, comparing measures of central tendency and identifying any anomalies in the distribution of data
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT716_ - They plan and conduct statistical investigations involving discrete and continuous numerical data, using appropriate displays.
	- _ASMAT717_ - Students interpret data in terms of the shape of distribution and summary statistics, identifying possible outliers.
	- _ASMAT718_ - They decide which measure of central tendency is most suitable and explain their reasoning.
