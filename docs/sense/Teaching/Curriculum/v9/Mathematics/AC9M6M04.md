> identify the relationships between angles on a straight line, angles at a point and vertically opposite angles; use these to determine unknown angles, communicating reasoning

Elaborations


- _AC9M6M04_E1_ - using protractors or dynamic geometry software to measure and generalise about the size of angles formed when lines are crossed, and combinations of angles that meet at a point, including combinations that form right or straight angles

- _AC9M6M04_E2_ - demonstrating the meaning of language associated with properties of angles, including right, complementary, complement, straight, supplement, vertically opposite, and angles at a point

- _AC9M6M04_E3_ - using the properties of supplementary and complementary angles to represent spatial situations with number sentences and solving to find the size of unknown angles
