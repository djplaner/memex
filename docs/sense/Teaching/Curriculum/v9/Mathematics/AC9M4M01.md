> interpret unmarked and partial units when measuring and comparing attributes of length, mass, capacity, duration and temperature, using scaled and digital instruments and appropriate units

Elaborations


- _AC9M4M01_E1_ - reading the mass of objects measured with digital and analog kitchen scales and explaining what unit of mass the lines on the analog scales refer to

- _AC9M4M01_E2_ - deciding on which attribute, unit and measuring instrument to use to compare the length and mass of various things, such as the distance travelled by an object in a science investigation; explaining the use of units such as grams or millimetres to give accurate measures when needed

- _AC9M4M01_E3_ - using scaled instruments such as tape measures, measuring jugs, kitchen scales and thermometers, recording measures using whole units; for example, \(560\) millimetres, or whole and part units; for example, \(5.25\) metres, \(1.75\) litres, \(2.5\) kilograms, \(28.5\)Â° Celsius

- _AC9M4M01_E4_ - reading and interpreting the scale of an analog clock without marked minutes to estimate the time to the nearest minute and to determine the duration of time between events

- _AC9M4M01_E5_ - using the timer or alarm function of a clock to alert when a specified duration has elapsed from a given starting time; for example, the different activities of an exercise routine

- _AC9M4M01_E6_ - making a scaled measuring instrument such as a tape measure, ruler, sand timer, sun dial or measuring cup using scaled instruments and direct comparisons

- _AC9M4M01_E7_ - exploring the different types of scaled instruments used by First Nations Ranger Groups and other groups to make decisions about caring for Country/Place, and modelling these in local contexts
