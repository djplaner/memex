> use Pythagoras’ theorem to solve problems involving the side lengths of right-angled triangles

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M8M06_E1_ - discussing and comparing different applications, demonstrations and proofs of Pythagoras’ theorem, from Egypt and Mesopotamia, Greece, India and China with other historical and contemporary applications and proofs
	- _AC9M8M06_E2_ - using Pythagoras’ theorem to determine unknown lengths of sides in right-angled triangles and finding lengths of sides of right-angled triangles in practical applications
	- _AC9M8M06_E3_ - recognising the relationship between the squares of lengths of sides for different types of triangles: right-angled, acute or obtuse
	- _AC9M8M06_E4_ - identifying Pythagorean triples, such as (\(3,4,5\)), (\(5,12,13\)), (\(7, 24, 25\)) and (\(8,15, 17\))
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT810_ - They use Pythagoras’ theorem to solve measurement problems involving unknown lengths of right-angle triangles.
