> use Pythagoras’ theorem to solve problems involving the side lengths of right-angled triangles

Elaborations


- _AC9M8M06_E1_ - discussing and comparing different applications, demonstrations and proofs of Pythagoras’ theorem, from Egypt and Mesopotamia, Greece, India and China with other historical and contemporary applications and proofs

- _AC9M8M06_E2_ - using Pythagoras’ theorem to determine unknown lengths of sides in right-angled triangles and finding lengths of sides of right-angled triangles in practical applications

- _AC9M8M06_E3_ - recognising the relationship between the squares of lengths of sides for different types of triangles: right-angled, acute or obtuse

- _AC9M8M06_E4_ - identifying Pythagorean triples, such as ( \(3,4,5\) ), (\(5,12,13\)), (\(7, 24, 25\)) and (\(8,15, 17\))
