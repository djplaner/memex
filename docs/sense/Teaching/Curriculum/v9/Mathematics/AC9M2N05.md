> multiply and divide by one-digit numbers using repeated addition, equal grouping, arrays, and partitioning to support a variety of calculation strategies

Elaborations


- _AC9M2N05_E1_ - making and naming arrays and using bar models to solve simple multiplication or sharing problems; for example, make different arrays to represent \(12\) and name them as “\(3\) fours”, “\(2\) sixes”, “\(4\) threes”, “\(6\) twos”; using physical or virtual materials to make arrays or using bar models to demonstrate that “\(3\) fours” is equal to “\(4\) threes”

- _AC9M2N05_E2_ - finding the total number represented in an array by partitioning the array using subitising and number facts; for example, describing how they determined the total number of dots arranged in a “\(3\) fives” array by saying “I saw \(2\) fives which is \(10\) and then \(5\) more which makes \(15\)”

- _AC9M2N05_E3_ - recognising problems that can be solved using division and identifying the difference between dividing a set of objects into \(3\) equal groups and dividing the same set of objects into groups of \(3\)

- _AC9M2N05_E4_ - using a Think Board to solve partition and quotition division problems; for example, sharing a prize of \(\$36\) between \(4\) people, using materials, a diagram and skip counting to find the answer; explaining whether the answer \(9\) refers to people or dollars

- _AC9M2N05_E5_ - using materials or diagrams, and skip counting to solve repeated equal quantity multiplication problems; for example, “Four trays of biscuits with \(6\) on each tray, how many biscuits are there?”; writing a repeated addition number sentence and using skip counting to solve
