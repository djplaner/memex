> compare and order fractions with the same and related denominators including mixed numerals, applying knowledge of factors and multiples; represent these fractions on a number line

Elaborations


- _AC9M5N03_E1_ - using pattern blocks to represent equivalent fractions; selecting one block or a combination of blocks to represent one whole, and making a design with shapes; recording the fractions to justify the total

- _AC9M5N03_E2_ - creating a fraction wall from paper tape to model and compare a range of different fractions with related denominators; using the model to play fraction wall games

- _AC9M5N03_E3_ - connecting a fraction wall model and a number line model of fractions to say how they are the same and how they are different; for example, explaining \(\frac14\) on a fraction wall represents the area of one-quarter of the whole while on the number line \(\frac14\) is identified as a point that is one-quarter of the distance between zero and one

- _AC9M5N03_E4_ - using an understanding of factors and multiples as well as equivalence to recognise efficient methods for the location of fractions with related denominators on parallel number lines; for example, explaining on parallel number lines that \(\frac2{10}\) is located at the same position on a parallel number line as \(\frac15\) because \(\frac15\) is equivalent to \(\frac2{10}\)

- _AC9M5N03_E5_ - converting between mixed numerals and improper fractions to assist with locating them on a number line
