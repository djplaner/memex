> create and use algorithms involving a sequence of steps and decisions and digital tools to experiment with factors, multiples and divisibility; identify, interpret and describe emerging patterns

Elaborations


- _AC9M5N10_E1_ - creating algorithms that use multiplication and division facts to determine if a number is a multiple or factor of another number; for example, using a flow chart that determines whether numbers are factors or multiples of other numbers using branching, such as yes/no decisions

- _AC9M5N10_E2_ - identifying lowest common multiples and highest common factors of pairs or triples of natural numbers; for example, the lowest common multiple of {\(6, 9\)} is \(18\), and the highest common factor is \(3\); the lowest common multiple of {\(3, 4, 5\)} is \(60\) and the highest common factor is one

- _AC9M5N10_E3_ - using the “fill down” function of a spreadsheet and a multiplication formula to generate a sequence of numbers that represent the multiples of any number you enter into the cell; describing and explaining the emerging patterns
