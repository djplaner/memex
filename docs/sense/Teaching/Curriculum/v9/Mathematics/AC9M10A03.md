> recognise the connection between algebraic and graphical representations of exponential relations and solve related exponential equations, using digital tools where appropriate

Elaborations


- _AC9M10A03_E1_ - recognising that in a table of values, if the ratio between consecutive values of the dependent variable is constant, then it is an exponential relation

- _AC9M10A03_E2_ - investigating the links between algebraic and graphical representations of exponential functions using graphing software

- _AC9M10A03_E3_ - using digital tools with symbolic manipulation functionality to systematically explore exponential relations

- _AC9M10A03_E4_ - investigating First Nations Australian Ranger groups’ and other groups’ programs that attempt to eradicate feral animals for survival of native animals on Country/Place, exploring the competition between feral and native animals and their impact on natural resources by formulating exponential equations for population growth for each animal species
