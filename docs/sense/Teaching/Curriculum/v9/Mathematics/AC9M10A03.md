> recognise the connection between algebraic and graphical representations of exponential relations and solve related exponential equations, using digital tools where appropriate

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M10A03_E1_ - recognising that in a table of values, if the ratio between consecutive values of the dependent variable is constant, then it is an exponential relation
	- _AC9M10A03_E2_ - investigating the links between algebraic and graphical representations of exponential functions using graphing software
	- _AC9M10A03_E3_ - using digital tools with symbolic manipulation functionality to systematically explore exponential relations
	- _AC9M10A03_E4_ - investigating First Nations Australian Ranger groups’ and other groups’ programs that attempt to eradicate feral animals for survival of native animals on Country/Place, exploring the competition between feral and native animals and their impact on natural resources by formulating exponential equations for population growth for each animal species
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT1002_ - They use mathematical modelling to solve problems involving growth and decay in financial and other applied situations, applying  linear,  quadratic and exponential functions as appropriate, and solve related equations, numerically and graphically.
