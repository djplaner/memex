> recognise and describe one-half as one of 2 equal parts of a whole and connect halves, quarters and eighths through repeated halving

Elaborations


- _AC9M2N03_E1_ - creating halves of a range of collections sets by sharing collections into \(2\) equal groups; for example, comparing half of a set of \(12\) washers with half of a set of \(8\) bolts to identify how they both represent one-half of their respective set

- _AC9M2N03_E2_ - creating halves using measurement attributes; for example, explaining that “a half is one part out of \(2\) equal parts of a whole”; equally folding a strip of paper, dividing a lump of playdough or separating a cup of water into \(2\) equal parts, then selecting one of the parts and naming it “one-half”; comparing half of a collection of \(10\) counters with half of a shape or object and explaining how each shows one-half of their respective wholes

- _AC9M2N03_E3_ - using repeated halving to subdivide shapes and objects in different ways to make corresponding halves, quarters and eighths; naming the parts and comparing the size of them to notice that they are all the same size, and demonstrating that a quarter is a half of a half and that an eighth is a half of a quarter

- _AC9M2N03_E4_ - dividing a shape into equal parts and relating the number of parts to the unit fraction; for example, if there are \(4\) equal parts then each part is a one-quarter and if there are \(8\) equal parts then each is one-eighth
