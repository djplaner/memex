> identify the impact of measurement errors on the accuracy of results in practical contexts

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M10M04_E1_ - describing settings where measurement errors may impact research results and how measurement data impacted by error can result in biased findings
	- _AC9M10M04_E2_ - analysing instruments and methods for measuring in investigations and modelling activities
	- _AC9M10M04_E3_ - determining the impact that compounding errors have on financial calculations; for example, considering the effect of truncation on money amounts for large scale customer populations
	- _AC9M10M04_E4_ - investigating scientific measuring techniques, including dating methods and genetic sequencing, applied to First Peoples of Australia and their artefacts, and the social impact of measurement errors
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT1008_ - They identify the impact of measurement errors on the accuracy of results.
