> estimate, construct and measure angles in degrees, using appropriate tools including a protractor, and relate these measures to angle names

Elaborations


- _AC9M5M04_E1_ - using a protractor to measure angles in degrees and classifying these angles using angle names; for example, an acute angle is less than \(90\)°, an obtuse angle is more than \(90\)° and less than \(180\)°, a right angle is equal to \(90\)° and a reflex angle is more than \(180\)° and less than \(360\)°

- _AC9M5M04_E2_ - estimating the size of angles in the environment using a clinometer and describing the angles using angle names

- _AC9M5M04_E3_ - using a ruler and protractor to construct triangles, given the angle measures and side lengths

- _AC9M5M04_E4_ - using a protractor to measure angles when creating a pattern or string design within a circle

- _AC9M5M04_E5_ - recognising the size of angles within shapes that do and do not tesselate, measuring the angles and using the sum of angles to explain why some shapes will tesselate and other shapes do not
