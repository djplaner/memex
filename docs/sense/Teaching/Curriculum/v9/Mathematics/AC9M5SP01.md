> connect objects to their nets and build objects from their nets using spatial and geometric reasoning

Elaborations


- _AC9M5SP01_E1_ - designing and constructing exact nets for packaging particular shaped items or collections of interest, taking into consideration how the faces will be joined and how the package will be opened

- _AC9M5SP01_E2_ - visualising folding some possible nets for a range of prisms and pyramids, predicating which will work and which cannot work, and justifying their choices, based on the number, size and position of particular shapes in each diagram

- _AC9M5SP01_E3_ - sketching nets for a range of prisms and pyramids considering the number, shape and placement of the faces, and test by cutting and folding

- _AC9M5SP01_E4_ - investigating objects designed and developed by First Nations Australians, such as those used in fish traps and instructive toys, identifying the shape and relative position of each face to determine the net of the object
