> classify triangles, quadrilaterals and other polygons according to their side and angle properties; identify and reason about relationships

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M7SP02_E1_ - using strips of paper with parallel sides to make triangles and quadrilaterals, and contrasting the rigidity of triangles with the flexibility of quadrilaterals
	- _AC9M7SP02_E2_ - constructing triangles with \(3\) given side lengths and discussing the question, “Can any \(3\) lengths be used to form the sides of a triangle?”
	- _AC9M7SP02_E3_ - identifying and communicating about side and angle properties of scalene, isosceles, equilateral, right-angled, acute and obtuse triangles using geometric conventions
	- _AC9M7SP02_E4_ - describing, comparing and contrasting squares, rectangles, rhombuses, parallelograms, kites and trapeziums, explaining the relationships between these shapes
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT713_ - Students classify polygons according to their features and create an algorithm designed to sort and classify shapes.
