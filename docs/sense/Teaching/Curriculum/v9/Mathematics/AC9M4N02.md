> explain and use the properties of odd and even numbers

Elaborations


- _AC9M4N02_E1_ - identifying even numbers and explaining why all numbers that end in the digits 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 are even and that numbers ending in 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 are odd

- _AC9M4N02_E2_ - explaining why some materials can be shared evenly between \(2\) people without leaving a remainder and some cannot

- _AC9M4N02_E3_ - explaining the patterns involved in adding, subtracting and multiplying odd and even numbers; for example, even + even = even, odd + even = odd, odd + odd = even and using this to decide whether answers to addition, subtraction and multiplication calculations are correct or not

- _AC9M4N02_E4_ - following an algorithm consisting of a flow chart with a series of instructions and decisions to determine whether a number is even or odd; using the algorithm to identify which elements of a set of numbers are divisible by \(2\)
