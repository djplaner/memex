Elaborations


- _AC9M5N08_E1_ - interpreting a series of contextual problems to decide whether an exact answer or an approximate calculation is appropriate; explaining their reasoning in relation to the context and the numbers involved

- _AC9M5N08_E2_ - recognising the effect of rounding addition, subtraction, multiplication and division calculations, rounding both numbers up, both numbers down, and one number up and one number down; explaining which estimation is the best approximation and why

- _AC9M5N08_E3_ - considering the type of rounding that is appropriate when estimating the amount of money required; for example, rounding up or rounding down when buying one item from a store using cash, compared to rounding up the cost of every item when buying groceries to estimate the total cost and not rounding when the financial transactions are digital
