> follow and create algorithms involving a sequence of steps and decisions that use addition or multiplication to generate sets of numbers; identify and describe any emerging patterns

Elaborations


- _AC9M4N09_E1_ - creating an algorithm that will generate number sequences involving multiples of one to \(10\) using digital tools to assist, identifying and explaining emerging patterns, recognising that number sequences can be extended indefinitely

- _AC9M4N09_E2_ - creating a basic flow chart that represents an algorithm that will generate a sequence of numbers using multiplication by a constant term; using a calculator to model and follow the algorithm, and record the sequence of numbers generated; checking results and describing any emerging patterns

- _AC9M4N09_E3_ - using a multiplication formula in a spreadsheet and the “fill down” function to generate a sequence of numbers; for example, entering the number one in the cell A1, using “fill down” to cell A100, entering the formula “ = A1*4 “ in the cell B1 and using the “fill down” function to generate a sequence of 100 numbers; describing emerging patterns
