> demonstrate that the interior angle sum of a triangle in the plane is 180° and apply this to determine the interior angle sum of other shapes and the size of unknown angles

Elaborations


- _AC9M7M05_E1_ - using concrete materials to demonstrate that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180°; for example, using paper triangles and tearing to demonstrate that the interior angles when combined form 180°

- _AC9M7M05_E2_ - using decomposition and the angle sum of a triangle to generalise the interior angle sum of an \(n\)-sided polygon, as \(180(n-2)\;=\;180n-360\)
