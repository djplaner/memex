> find equivalent representations of fractions using related denominators and make connections between fractions and decimal notation

Elaborations


- _AC9M4N03_E1_ - extending fraction families within collections of materials; for example, by seeing \(\frac34\) as \(3\) in each \(4\), showing this within related fractions like \(\frac68\) or seeing that \(\frac25\) means \(2\) in each \(5\) so it can be shown within \(\frac4{10}\)

- _AC9M4N03_E2_ - creating models of equivalent fractions by subdividing capacity measures into smaller fractions; for example, half a cup of flour could be shown as two-quarters or four-eighths of a cup of flour

- _AC9M4N03_E3_ - folding paper to show equivalence between different fractions; for example, folding A4 paper in half and half again, repeating to form eighths and demonstrating that \(\frac48\) = \(\frac24\) = \(\frac12\); folding paper strips into fifths and tenths, and recording as both fractions and decimals 

- _AC9M4N03_E4_ - identifying and using the connection between fractions of metres and decimals; for example, finding \(\frac14\) of a metre and connecting this to \(0.25\) metres or \(25\) centimetres, or finding \(\frac1{10}\) of a metre and connecting this with \(0.10\) metres or \(10\) centimetres

- _AC9M4N03_E5_ - using array diagrams to show the relationship between fractions and division and multiplication of natural numbers; for example, \(3 \times 4 = 12\), \(12 รท 4 = 3\), \(\frac14\) of \(12\) is \(3\), \(\frac13\) of \(12\) is \(4\)
