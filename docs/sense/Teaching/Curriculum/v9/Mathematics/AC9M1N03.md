> quantify sets of objects, to at least 120, by partitioning collections into equal groups using number knowledge and skip counting

Elaborations


- _AC9M1N03_E1_ - counting a large collection of items using groups of fives or tens and skip counting to work out how many there are; recording the amount and connecting the digits in the number to the grouped materials when using groups of \(10\)

- _AC9M1N03_E2_ - counting collections of objects such as pencils or images of birds in a tree, by grouping them in tens to enable efficient counting and connecting the digits in the number to the groups of tens and ones

- _AC9M1N03_E3_ - counting a large collection of Australian \(\$1\) coins by stacking them into piles of \(10\), skip counting in tens and including any leftover coins to determine the total value
