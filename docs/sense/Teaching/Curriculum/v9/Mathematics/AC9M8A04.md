> experiment with linear functions and relations using digital tools, making and testing conjectures and generalising emerging patterns

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M8A04_E1_ - using graphing software to investigate the effect of systematically varying parameters of linear functions on the corresponding graphs, making and testing conjectures; for example, making a conjecture that if the co-efficient of \(x\) is negative, then the line will slope down from left to right
	- _AC9M8A04_E2_ - using graphing software to systematically contrast the graphs of \(y\;=\;2x\), -\(y\;=\;2x\), \(y\;=\;\)-\(2x\) and -\(y\;=\;\)-\(2x\) with those of \(y<2x\), \(-y<2x\), \(y<\)-\(2x\) and -\(y<\)-\(2x\) and those of \(y>2x\), -\(y>2x\), \(y>\)-\(2x\) and -\(y>\)-\(2x\), making and testing conjectures about sign and direction of the inequality
	- _AC9M8A04_E3_ - using digital tools to investigate integer solutions to equations such as \(2x+3y\;=\;48\)
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT808_ - They make and test conjectures involving linear relations using digital tools.
