> determine all possible combinations for 2 events, using two-way tables, tree diagrams and Venn diagrams, and use these to determine probabilities of specific outcomes in practical situations

Elaborations


- _AC9M8P02_E1_ - describing events using language of “at least”, exclusive “or” (\(A\) or \(B\) but not both), inclusive “or” (\(A\) or \(B\) or both) and “and”

- _AC9M8P02_E2_ - using the relation \(Pr(A\;and\;B)+Pr(A\;and\;not\;B)+Pr(not\;A\;and\;B)+Pr(not\;A\;and\;not\;B)=\;1\) to calculate probabilities, including the special case of mutually exclusive events where \(Pr(A\;and\;B)\;=\;0\)

- _AC9M8P02_E3_ - using Venn diagrams or two-way tables to demonstrate the difference between events that are mutually exclusive, such as whether a coin toss will land on a head or a tail, or those that are not mutually exclusive, such as people who have blonde hair and people who have blue eyes

- _AC9M8P02_E4_ - exploring First Nations Australian children’s instructive games; for example, Battendi from the Ngarrindjeri Peoples of Lake Murray and Lake Albert in southern Australia, applying possible combinations and relationships and calculating probabilities using two-way tables and Venn diagrams
