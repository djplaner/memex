> design, create and test algorithms involving a sequence of steps and decisions that identify congruency or similarity of shapes, and describe how the algorithm works

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M8SP04_E1_ - listing the properties or criteria necessary to determine if shapes are similar or congruent
	- _AC9M8SP04_E2_ - using the conditions for congruence of triangles and similarity of triangles to develop a sorting algorithm; for example, creating a flow chart
	- _AC9M8SP04_E3_ - evaluating algorithms for accuracy in classifying and distinguishing between similar and congruent triangles
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT814_ - They identify conditions for congruency and similarity in shapes and create and test algorithms designed to test for congruency and similarity.
