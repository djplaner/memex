> design, create and test algorithms involving a sequence of steps and decisions that identify congruency or similarity of shapes, and describe how the algorithm works

Elaborations


- _AC9M8SP04_E1_ - listing the properties or criteria necessary to determine if shapes are similar or congruent

- _AC9M8SP04_E2_ - using the conditions for congruence of triangles and similarity of triangles to develop a sorting algorithm; for example, creating a flow chart

- _AC9M8SP04_E3_ - evaluating algorithms for accuracy in classifying and distinguishing between similar and congruent triangles
