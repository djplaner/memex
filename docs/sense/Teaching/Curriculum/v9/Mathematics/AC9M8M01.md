> solve problems involving the area and perimeter of irregular and composite shapes using appropriate units

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M8M01_E1_ - determining the area of composite shapes by composing or decomposing shapes
	- _AC9M8M01_E2_ - using arrays and rectangles to approximate the area of irregular shapes in situations such as a council needing to work out how much mosquito spray to use for a swamp area or a farmer needing to work out how much seed, fertilizer and herbicide are required to cover a paddock
	- _AC9M8M01_E3_ - determining the perimeter and area of irregular shapes by sums of increasingly accurate covering measurements, such as line segments and grids; for example, using millimetres or square millimetres as opposed to centimetres or square centimetres
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT809_ - Students use appropriate metric units when solving measurement problems involving the perimeter and area of composite shapes, and volume of right prisms.
