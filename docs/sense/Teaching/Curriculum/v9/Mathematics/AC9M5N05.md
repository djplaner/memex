> solve problems involving addition and subtraction of fractions with the same or related denominators, using different strategies

Elaborations


- _AC9M5N05_E1_ - using different ways to add and subtract fractional amounts by subdividing different models of measurement attributes; for example, adding half an hour and three-quarters of an hour using a clock face, adding a \(\frac34\) cup of flour and a \(\frac14\) cup of flour, subtracting \(\frac34\) of a metre from \(2\frac14\) metres

- _AC9M5N05_E2_ - representing and solving addition and subtraction problems involving fractions by using jumps on a number line, bar models or making diagrams of fractions as parts of shapes

- _AC9M5N05_E3_ - using materials, diagrams, number lines or arrays to show and explain that fraction number sentences can be rewritten in equivalent forms without changing the quantity; for example, \(\frac12\) + \(\frac14\)  is the same as \(\frac24\) + \(\frac14\)
