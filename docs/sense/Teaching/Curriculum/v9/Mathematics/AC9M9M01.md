> solve problems involving the volume and surface area of right prisms and cylinders using appropriate units

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M9M01_E1_ - analysing nets of objects to generate short cuts and establish formulas for surface area
	- _AC9M9M01_E2_ - determining the amount of material needed to make can-coolers for a class fundraising project and working out the most cost-efficient way to cut out the pieces
	- _AC9M9M01_E3_ - finding different prisms that have the same volume but different surface areas, making conjectures as to what type of prism would have the smallest or largest surface area
	- _AC9M9M01_E4_ - investigating objects and technologies of First Nations Australians, analysing and connecting surface area and volume, and exploring their relationship to their capacity
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT908_ - They apply formulas to solve problems involving the surface area and volume of right prisms and cylinders.
