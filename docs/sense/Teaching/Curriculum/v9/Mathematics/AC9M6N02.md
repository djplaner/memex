> identify and describe the properties of prime, composite and square numbers and use these properties to solve problems and simplify calculations

Elaborations


- _AC9M6N02_E1_ - using the definition of a prime number to explain why one is not a prime number

- _AC9M6N02_E2_ - testing numbers by using division to distinguish between prime and composite numbers, recording the results on a number chart to identify any patterns

- _AC9M6N02_E3_ - representing composite numbers as a product of their factors, including prime factors when necessary and using this form to simplify calculations involving multiplication such as \(15 \times 16\) as \(5 \times 3 \times 4 \times 4\) which can be rearranged to simplify calculation to \(5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 4 = 20 \times 12\)

- _AC9M6N02_E4_ - identifying and describing the product of a number with itself as square; for example, \(3 \times 3\) is the same as \(3^2\)

- _AC9M6N02_E5_ - using spreadsheets to list all the numbers that have up to \(3\) factors, using combinations of only the first \(3\) prime numbers, recognise any emerging patterns, making conjectures and experimenting with other combinations
