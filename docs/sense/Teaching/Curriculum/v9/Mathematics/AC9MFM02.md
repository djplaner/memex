> sequence days of the week and times of the day including morning, lunchtime, afternoon and night time, and connect them to familiar events and actions

Elaborations


- _AC9MFM02_E1_ - ordering images of daily events on a string line across the room, and justifying the placement by referring to morning, lunchtime, afternoon, and night time

- _AC9MFM02_E2_ - distinguishing between the days of the school week and weekends, and recognising that the days of the week form a sequence that repeats, with Monday always following on from Sunday

- _AC9MFM02_E3_ - sequencing the events from a story in the order in which they occurred using language like, “This happened first” then “This happened next”

- _AC9MFM02_E4_ - creating, interpreting and discussing classroom rosters; for example, a roster for watering the classroom garden and asking, “Who watered the garden yesterday?” or “Whose turn is it today?”

- _AC9MFM02_E5_ - creating a pictorial diary to show the important events that happen on the various days of the week
