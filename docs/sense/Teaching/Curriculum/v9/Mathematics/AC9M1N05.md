> use mathematical modelling to solve practical problems involving additive situations including simple money transactions; represent the situations with diagrams, physical and virtual materials, and use calculation strategies to solve the problem

Elaborations


- _AC9M1N05_E1_ - modelling problems involving addition and subtraction presented in stories, using a Think Board to represent the problem, solving the problem using physical materials and explaining the connections between any materials used, the Think Board diagram and the numbers within the story

- _AC9M1N05_E2_ - modelling simple money problems involving addition and subtraction using whole dollar amounts; for example, setting up a shop and role-playing practical problems of buying and selling of goods, using addition and subtraction with play money and prices in whole dollar amounts; solving the problem “I had \(\$14\) and was given \(\$15\) for my birthday” using addition to answer the problem

- _AC9M1N05_E3_ - modelling a variety of different additive situations to solve practical problems; for example, keeping track of the number of people on a bus as it stops to pick up and drop off passengers or the number of people entering a lift
