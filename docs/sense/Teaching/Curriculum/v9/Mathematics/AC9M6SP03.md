> recognise and use combinations of transformations to create tessellations and other geometric patterns, using dynamic geometric software where appropriate

Elaborations


- _AC9M6SP04_E1_ - using digital tools to create tessellations of shapes, including paver and tiling patterns, describing the transformations used and discussing why these shapes tessellate; identifying shapes or combinations of shapes that will or will not tessellate, answering questions such as, â€œDo all triangles tessellate

- _AC9M6SP04_E2_ - designing a school or brand logo using the transformation of one or more shapes and describing the transformations used

- _AC9M6SP04_E3_ - using dynamic geometric software and digital tools to experiment with transformations; for example, to demonstrate when the order of transformations produces different results; experimenting with transformations and their application to fractals

- _AC9M6SP04_E4_ - designing an algorithm as a set of instructions to transform a shape, including getting back to where you started from; for example, programming a robot to move around the plane using instructions for movements, such as 2 down, 3 to the right, and combinations of these to transform shapes

- _AC9M6SP04_E5_ - investigating symmetry, transformation and tessellation in different shapes on Country/Place, including rock formations, insects, and land and sea animals, discussing the purpose or role symmetry plays in their physical structure
