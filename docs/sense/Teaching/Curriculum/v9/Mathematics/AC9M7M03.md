> describe the relationship between \(π\) and the features of circles including the circumference, radius and diameter

Elaborations


- _AC9M7M03_E1_ - recognising the features of circles and their relationships to one another; for example, labelling the parts of a circle including centre, radius, diameter, circumference and using one of radius, diameter or circumference to determine the measure of the other \(2\); understanding that the diameter of a circle is twice the radius, or that the radius is the circumference divided by \(2π\)

- _AC9M7M03_E2_ - comparing the circumference of circles in relation to their radius and diameter with materials and measuring, to establish measurement formulas; for example, using a compass to draw several circles, then using string to approximate the circumference, comparing the length of string to the diameter of the circle

- _AC9M7M03_E3_ - investigating \(π\) as the constant in the proportional relationship between the circumference of a circle and its diameter, and historical approximations from different civilisations, including Egypt, Babylon, Greece, India and China

- _AC9M7M03_E4_ - investigating the applications and significance of circles in everyday life of First Nations Australians such as in basketry, symbols and architecture, recognising the relationships between the centre, radius, diameter and circumference
