> solve problems involving the volume and capacity of right prisms using appropriate units

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M8M02_E1_ - using models to demonstrate the number of cubic centimetres in a cubic metre and relating this to capacities of millilitres and litres, recognising that one millilitre is equivalent to one cm\(^3\)
	- _AC9M8M02_E2_ - solving practical problems involving volume and capacity; for example, optimal packaging and production
	- _AC9M8M02_E3_ - choosing which measurements are useful to consider when solving practical problems in context; for example, when purchasing a new washing machine, the dimensions are useful when determining whether it will fit in the available space in the laundry and its capacity is useful when considering the maximum washing load it can carry
	- _AC9M8M02_E4_ - investigating, reasoning and finding solutions to measurement problems involving dimensions, rates, volume and capacity of objects; for example, given the dimensions of a pool and the rate of flow from a tap, determining how long it will take to fill the pool to its normal capacity
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT809_ - Students use appropriate metric units when solving measurement problems involving the perimeter and area of composite shapes, and volume of right prisms.
