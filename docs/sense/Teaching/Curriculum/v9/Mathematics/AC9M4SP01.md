> represent and approximate composite shapes and objects in the environment, using combinations of familiar shapes and objects

Elaborations


- _AC9M4SP01_E1_ - identifying common shapes that form part of a composite shape by re-creating these shapes using physical or virtual materials

- _AC9M4SP01_E2_ - physically or virtually using cubes to make three-dimensional models that approximate real objects; for example, building a virtual environment by using a computer software program to construct objects out of cubes

- _AC9M4SP01_E3_ - approximating complex shapes and objects in the environment with familiar shapes and objects; for example, drawing cartoon animals by combining familiar shapes

- _AC9M4SP01_E4_ - recognising how familiar shapes and objects are used in logos and other graphics to represent more complex shapes and creating logos using graphic design software
