> identify the sample space for single-stage events; assign probabilities to the outcomes of these events and predict relative frequencies for related events

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M7P01_E1_ - discussing the meaning of probability terminology; for example, “probability”, “sample space”, “favourable outcome”, “trial”, “experiment” and “event”
	- _AC9M7P01_E2_ - listing sample spaces for games involving throwing a coin or a dice, spinners, or lucky dip
	- _AC9M7P01_E3_ - assigning the probability for throwing a \(6\) on a dice and using this to predict the number of times a \(6\) will occur when a dice is thrown multiple times
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT719_ - Students list sample spaces for single step experiments, assign probabilities to outcomes and predict relative frequencies for related events.
	- _ASMAT720_ - They conduct repeated single-step chance experiments and run simulations using digital tools, giving reasons for differences between predicted and observed results.
