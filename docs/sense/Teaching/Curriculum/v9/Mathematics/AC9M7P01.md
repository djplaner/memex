> identify the sample space for single-stage events; assign probabilities to the outcomes of these events and predict relative frequencies for related events

Elaborations


- _AC9M7P01_E1_ - discussing the meaning of probability terminology; for example, “probability”, “sample space”, “favourable outcome”, “trial”, “experiment” and “event”

- _AC9M7P01_E2_ - listing sample spaces for games involving throwing a coin or a dice, spinners, or lucky dip

- _AC9M7P01_E3_ - assigning the probability for throwing a \(6\) on a dice and using this to predict the number of times a \(6\) will occur when a dice is thrown multiple times
