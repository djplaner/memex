> use mathematical modelling to solve practical problems involving ratios; formulate problems, interpret and communicate solutions in terms of the situation, justifying choices made about the representation

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M7M06_E1_ - using fractions to model and solve ratio problems involving comparison of quantities, and considering part-part and part-whole relations
	- _AC9M7M06_E2_ - modelling and solving practical problems involving ratios of length, capacity or mass, such as in construction, design, food or textile production; for example, mixing concrete, the golden ratio in design, mixing a salad dressing
	- _AC9M7M06_E3_ - modelling the situation using manipulatives, diagrams and/or mathematical discussion; for example, mixing primary colours in a variety of ratios to investigate how new colours are created and the strength of those colours
	- _AC9M7M06_E4_ - investigating commercialised substances founded on First Nations Australiansâ€™ knowledges of substances including pharmaceuticals and toxins, understanding how ratios are used in their development
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT706_ - They use mathematical modelling to solve practical problems involving rational numbers, percentages and ratios, in financial and other applied contexts, justifying choices of representation.
