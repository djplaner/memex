> recognise situations, including financial contexts, that use integers; locate and represent integers on a number line and as coordinates on the Cartesian plane

Elaborations


- _AC9M6N01_E1_ - extending the number line in the negative direction to locate and represent integers, recognising the difference in location between (-\(2\)) and (+\(2\)) and their relationship to zero as -\(2< 0< 2\)

- _AC9M6N01_E2_ - using integers to represent quantities in financial contexts, including the concept of profit and loss for a planned event

- _AC9M6N01_E3_ - using horizontal and vertical number lines to represent and find solutions to everyday problems involving locating and ordering integers around zero; for example, elevators, above and below sea level; distinguishing a location by referencing to the \(4\) quadrants of the Cartesian plane

- _AC9M6N01_E4_ - recognising that the sign (positive or negative) indicates a direction in relation to zero; for example, \(30\) metres left of the admin block is (-\(30\)) and \(20\) metres right of the admin block is (+\(20\)); programming robots to move along a number line which is either horizontal or vertical but not both at the same time

- _AC9M6N01_E5_ - representing the temperatures of the different planets in the solar system, using a diagram of a thermometer that models a vertical number line
