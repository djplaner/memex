> solve problems involving addition and subtraction of fractions using knowledge of equivalent fractions

Elaborations


- _AC9M6N05_E1_ - representing addition and subtraction of fractions, using an understanding of equivalent fractions and methods such as jumps on a number line, or diagrams of fractions as parts of shapes

- _AC9M6N05_E2_ - determining the lowest common denominator using an understanding of prime and composite numbers to find equivalent representation of fractions when solving addition and subtraction problems

- _AC9M6N05_E3_ - calculating the addition or subtraction of fractions in the context of realistic problems; for example, using part cups or spoons in a recipe; using the understanding of equivalent fractions

- _AC9M6N05_E4_ - understanding the processes for adding and subtracting fractions with related denominators and fractions as an operator, in preparation for calculating with all fractions; for example, using fraction overlays and number lines to give meaning to adding and subtracting fractions with related and unrelated denominators
