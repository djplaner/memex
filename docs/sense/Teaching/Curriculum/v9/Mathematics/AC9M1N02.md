> partition one- and two-digit numbers in different ways using physical and virtual materials, including partitioning two-digit numbers into tens and ones

Elaborations


- _AC9M1N02_E1_ - building knowledge and understanding of the part-part-whole facts to \(10\), using physical and virtual materials; for example, using virtual ten-frames through a digital app or website to identify pairs of numbers that combine to make \(10\)

- _AC9M1N02_E2_ - using physical and virtual materials to partition numbers into counts of tens and ones; for example, recognise \(35\) as \(3\) tens and \(5\) ones or as \(2\) tens and \(15\) ones

- _AC9M1N02_E3_ - using part-part-whole reasoning and physical or virtual materials to represent \(24\), then partitioning \(24\) in different ways and recording the partitions using numbers; for example, \(10, 10\) and \(4\) combine to make \(24\) or \(10\) and \(14\) combine to make \(24\)
