> extend and apply knowledge of addition and subtraction facts to 20 to develop efficient mental strategies for computation with larger numbers without a calculator

Elaborations


- _AC9M3A02_E1_ - partitioning using materials and part-part-whole diagrams to develop subtraction facts related to addition facts, such as \(8 + 7 = 15\) therefore, \(15 \space–\space 7 = 8\) and \(15\space – \space 8 = 7\)

- _AC9M3A02_E2_ - using partitioning to develop and record facts systematically; for example, “How many ways can \(12\) monkeys be spread among \(2\) trees?”, \(12 = 12 + 0\), \(12 = 11 + 1\), \(12 = 10 + 2\), \(12 = 9 + 3\), …; explaining how they know they have found all possible partitions

- _AC9M3A02_E3_ - understanding basic addition and related subtraction facts and using extensions to these facts; for example, \(6 + 6 = 12, 16 + 6 = 22, 6 + 7 = 13, 16 + 7 = 23\), and \(60 + 60 = 120, 600 + 600 = 1200\)
