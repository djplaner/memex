> use the language of “if .... then”, “given”, “of”, “knowing that” to describe and interpret situations involving conditional probability

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M10P01_E1_ - using two-way tables and Venn diagrams to understand conditional statements using the language of “if  ... then ...”, “given”, “of”, “knowing that” and identifying common mistakes in interpreting such language
	- _AC9M10P01_E2_ - using arrays and tree diagrams to represent, interpret and compare probabilities of dependent and independent events
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT1016_ - They apply conditional probability  to solve problems involving compound events.
	- _ASMAT1017_ - Students design and conduct simulations involving conditional probability, using digital tools.
