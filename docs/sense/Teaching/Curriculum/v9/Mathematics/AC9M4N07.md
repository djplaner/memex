> choose and use estimation and rounding to check and explain the reasonableness of calculations including the results of financial transactions

Elaborations


- _AC9M4N07_E1_ - using proficiency with basic facts to estimate the result of a calculation and say what amounts the answer will be between; for example, \(5\) packets of biscuits at \(\$2.60\) each will cost between \(\$10\) and \(\$15\) as \(5 \times\)  \(\$2 =\$10\) and \(5\times\$3=\$15\)

- _AC9M4N07_E2_ - using rounded amounts to complete an estimated budget for a shopping trip or an excursion, explaining why overestimating the amounts is appropriate

- _AC9M4N07_E3_ - recognising the effect of rounding in addition and multiplication calculations; rounding both numbers up, both numbers down and one number up and one number down, and explaining which is the best approximation and why
