> identify practical activities and everyday events involving chance; describe possible outcomes and events as ‘likely’ or ‘unlikely’ and identify some events as ‘certain’ or ‘impossible’ explaining reasoning

Elaborations


- _AC9M3P01_E1_ - predicting what could happen next in practical activities that involve an element of chance, considering possible outcomes and using terms such as “likely” or “unlikely” to explain their predictions

- _AC9M3P01_E2_ - classifying a list of everyday events or sorting a set of event cards according to how likely they are to happen, using the language of chance and giving reasons for classifications; discussing how impossible outcomes cannot ever happen, uncertain outcomes are affected by chance as they may or may not happen whereas certain events must always happen, so they are not affected by chance

- _AC9M3P01_E3_ - making predictions and testing what would happen; for example, if \(10\) names were put in a box, and names were then drawn out one at a time and replaced after each selection, discussing how likely it would be after \(10\) selections that all \(10\) names were drawn from the box or that one name was drawn multiple times
