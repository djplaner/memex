> recall and demonstrate proficiency with multiplication facts for \(3, 4, 5\) and \(10\); extend and apply facts to develop the related division facts

Elaborations


- _AC9M3A03_E1_ - using concrete or virtual manipulatives, groups and repeated addition to recognise patterns and establish the \(3, 4, 5\) and \(10\) multiplication facts; ; using the language of “\(3\) groups of \(2\) equals \(6\)” to develop into “\(3\) twos are \(6\)” and extend to establish the \(3 \times 10\) multiplication facts and related division facts

- _AC9M3A03_E2_ - recognising that when they multiply a number by \(5\), the resulting number will either end in a \(5\) or a zero; using a calculator or spreadsheet to generate a list of the multiples of \(5\) to develop the multiplication and related division facts for fives

- _AC9M3A03_E3_ - practising calculating and deriving multiplication facts for \(3, 4, 5\) and \(10\), explaining and recalling the patterns in them and using them to derive related division facts

- _AC9M3A03_E4_ - systematically exploring algorithms used for repeated addition, comparing and describing what is happening, and using them to establish the multiplication facts for \(3, 4, 5\) and \(10\); for example, following the sequence of steps, the decisions being made and the resulting solution, recognising and generalising any emerging patterns
