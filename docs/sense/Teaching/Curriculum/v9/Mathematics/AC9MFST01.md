- _AC9MFST01_E2_ - collecting and deciding how to organise data to answer “Yes/No” questions; for example, “Do more people in our class today have shoes with laces than without?”; explaining that lining up, and matching shoes with and without laces one-to-one will answer the question

- _AC9MFST01_E4_ - investigating statistical contexts after reading a story, such as "The Waterhole" by Graeme Base; asking and responding to questions like “What different animals did you see?”, “How many different types of animals were there?” or “Were there more tigers or kangaroos?”
