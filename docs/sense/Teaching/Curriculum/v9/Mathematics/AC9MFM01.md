> identify and compare attributes of objects and events, including length, capacity, mass and duration, using direct comparisons and communicating reasoning

Elaborations


- _AC9MFM01_E1_ - using language to describe the measurement attributes of length, mass, capacity and duration, and connecting the words with the appropriate attribute; for example, using words like “tall”, “short”, “wide”, “long”, “high” to describe the attribute of length

- _AC9MFM01_E2_ - directly comparing pairs of objects to say which is longer/shorter, and explaining or demonstrating how they know; for example, standing back-to-back to determine who is taller; choosing to line up the bases of a spoon and fork to decide which is longer and explaining why

- _AC9MFM01_E3_ - starting \(2\) events at the same time to decide which takes longer; for example, putting on a pair of sandals with buckles or Velcro, describing the duration using familiar terms and reasoning, “I took a longer time because I’m still learning to do up my buckles”

- _AC9MFM01_E4_ - directly comparing pairs of everyday objects from the kitchen pantry to say which is heavier/lighter; for example, hefting a tin of baked beans and a packet of marshmallows; comparing the same pair of objects to say which is longer/shorter and discussing comparisons
