> construct a grid coordinate system that uses coordinates to locate positions within a space; use coordinates and directional language to describe position and movement

Elaborations


- _AC9M5SP02_E1_ - understanding how the numbers on the axes on a grid coordinate system are numbers on a number line and are used to pinpoint locations

- _AC9M5SP02_E2_ - discussing the conventions of indicating a point in a grid coordinate system; for example, writing the horizontal axis number first and the vertical axis number second, using brackets and commas

- _AC9M5SP02_E3_ - comparing a grid reference system to a grid coordinate system (first quadrant only) by using both to play strategy games involving location; for example, “Quadrant Commander”, deducing that in a grid coordinate system the lines are numbered (starting from zero), not the spaces

- _AC9M5SP02_E4_ - placing a coordinate grid over a contour line, drawing and listing the coordinates of each point in the picture, asking a peer to re-create the drawing using only the list of coordinates, and discussing the reasons for the potential similarities and differences between the \(2\) drawings
