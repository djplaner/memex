> find unknown values in numerical equations involving brackets and combinations of arithmetic operations, using the properties of numbers and operations

Elaborations


- _AC9M6A02_E1_ - using brackets and the order of operations to write number sentences and appreciating the need for an agreed set of rules to complete multiple operations within the same number sentence; for example, for \(40 รท 2 \times (4 + 6) = \square\), you solve what is in the brackets first then complete the number sentence from left to right as there is no hierarchy between division and multiplication

- _AC9M6A02_E2_ - constructing equivalent number sentences involving brackets and combinations of the \(4\) operations; explaining the need to have shared agreement on the order of operations when solving problems involving more than one operation to have unique solutions

- _AC9M6A02_E3_ - finding pairs of unknown values in numerical equations that make the equation hold true; for example, listing possible combinations of natural numbers that make this statement true: \(6+4\times8\;=\;6\times\bigtriangleup+\square\)

- _AC9M6A02_E4_ - applying knowledge of inverse operations and number properties to create equivalent number sentences; removing one of the numbers and replacing it with a symbol, then swapping with a classmate to find the unknown values
