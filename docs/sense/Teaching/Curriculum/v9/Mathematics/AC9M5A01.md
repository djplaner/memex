> recognise and explain the connection between multiplication and division as inverse operations and use this to develop families of number facts

Elaborations


- _AC9M5A01_E1_ - using materials or diagrams to develop and explain division strategies, such as halving, using the inverse relationship to turn division into a multiplication

- _AC9M5A01_E2_ - using arrays, multiplication tables, and physical and virtual materials to develop families of facts; for example, \(3 \times 4 = 12\), \(4 \times 3 = 12\), \(12 ÷ 3 = 4\) and \(12 ÷ 4 = 3\)

- _AC9M5A01_E3_ - demonstrating multiplicative partitioning using materials, diagrams or arrays and recording \(2\) multiplication and \(2\) division facts for each grouping; \(4 \times 6 = 24\), \(6 \times 4 = 24\), \(24 ÷ 4 = 6\) and \(24 ÷ 6 = 4\); explaining how each is different from and connected to groups in the materials, diagrams or arrays

- _AC9M5A01_E4_ - using materials, diagrams or arrays to recognise and explain the inverse relationship between multiplication and division; for example, solving \(240 ÷ 20 = \square\) by thinking \(20\times\square = 240\); using the inverse to make calculations easier; for example, solving \(17\times\square= 221\) using division, \(\square = 221 ÷ 17\)
