> use mathematical modelling to solve practical problems involving additive and multiplicative situations, including money transactions; represent situations and choose calculation strategies; interpret and communicate solutions in terms of the situation

Elaborations


- _AC9M2N06_E1_ - modelling practical problems by interpreting an everyday additive or multiplicative situation; for example, making a number of purchases at a store and deciding whether to use addition or subtraction, multiplication or division to solve the problem and justifying the choice of operation; for example, “I used subtraction to solve this problem as I knew the total and one of the parts, so I needed to subtract to find the missing part”

- _AC9M2N06_E2_ - modelling and solving simple money problems involving whole dollar amounts with addition, subtraction, multiplication or division; for example, if each member of our class contributes \(\$5\), how much money will we have in total?

- _AC9M2N06_E3_ - modelling and solving practical problems such as deciding how many people should be in each team for a game or sports event, how many teams for a given game can be filled from a class, how to share out some food or distributing money in whole dollar amounts, including deciding what to do if there is a remainder

- _AC9M2N06_E4_ - modelling and solving the problem “How many days are there left in this year?” by using a calendar

- _AC9M2N06_E5_ - modelling problems involving equal grouping and sharing in First Nations Australian children’s instructive games; for example, Yangamini from the Tiwi Island Peoples, representing relationships with a number sentence and interpreting and communicating solutions in terms of the context
