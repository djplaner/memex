> describe transformations of a set of points using coordinates in the Cartesian plane, translations and reflections on an axis, and rotations about a given point

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M7SP03_E1_ - using digital tools to transform shapes in the Cartesian plane, describing and recording the transformations
	- _AC9M7SP03_E2_ - describing patterns and investigating different ways to produce the same transformation, such as using \(2\) successive reflections to provide the same result as a translation
	- _AC9M7SP03_E3_ - experimenting with, creating and re-creating patterns using combinations of translations, reflections and rotations, using digital tools
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT715_ - Students use coordinates to describe transformations of points in the plane.
