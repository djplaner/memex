> represent objects in 2 dimensions; discuss and reason about the advantages and disadvantages of different representations

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M7SP01_E1_ - deconstructing packaging to identify shapes and nets
	- _AC9M7SP01_E2_ - using different nets to construct prisms and determining which nets will make a cube, rectangular prism, triangular prism or pyramid
	- _AC9M7SP01_E3_ - using aerial views of buildings and other three-dimensional structures to visualise the footprint made by the building or structure, identifying prisms that could approximate the structure
	- _AC9M7SP01_E4_ - building objects by interpreting isometric and perspective drawings
	- _AC9M7SP01_E5_ - using isometric and square grid paper to draw views of front, back, side, top and bottom of objects
	- _AC9M7SP01_E6_ - exploring different two-dimensional representations of objects in First Nations Australiansâ€™ artworks or cultural maps of Country/Place
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT714_ - They represent objects two-dimensionally in different ways, describing the usefulness of these representations.
