> solve practical problems involving the perimeter and area of regular and irregular shapes using appropriate metric units

Elaborations


- _AC9M5M02_E1_ - investigating problem situations involving perimeter; for example, “How many metres of fencing are required around a paddock, or around a festival event?”

- _AC9M5M02_E2_ - using efficient ways to calculate the perimeters of rectangles, such as adding the length and width together and doubling the result

- _AC9M5M02_E3_ - solving measurement problems, such as “How much carpet would be needed to cover the entire floor of the classroom”, using square metre templates to directly measure the floor space

- _AC9M5M02_E4_ - creating a model of a permaculture garden, dividing the area up to provide the most efficient use of space for gardens and walkways, labelling the measure of each area, and calculating the amount of resources needed; for example, compost to cover the vegetable garden

- _AC9M5M02_E5_ - using a physical or a virtual “geoboard app” to recognise the relationship between area and perimeter and solve problems; for example, investigating what is the largest and what is the smallest area that has the same perimeter

- _AC9M5M02_E6_ - exploring the designs of fishing nets and dwellings of First Nations Australians, investigating the perimeter, area and purpose of the shapes within the designs
