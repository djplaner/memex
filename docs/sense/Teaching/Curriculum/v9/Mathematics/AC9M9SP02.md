> apply the enlargement transformation to shapes and objects using dynamic geometry software as appropriate; identify and explain aspects that remain the same and those that change

Elaborations


- _AC9M9SP02_E1_ - comparing the ratio of lengths of corresponding sides of similar triangles and angles

- _AC9M9SP02_E2_ - using the properties of similarity to solve problems involving enlargement

- _AC9M9SP02_E3_ - investigating and generalising patterns in length, angle, area and volume when side lengths of shapes and objects are enlarged or dilated by whole and rational numbers; for example, comparing an enlargement of a square and a cube of side length \(2\) units by a factor of \(3\) increases the area of the square, \(2^2\), to \((3\times2)^2 = 9\times 2^2=9\) times the original area and the volume of the cube, \(2^3\), to \((3\times2)^3=27\times 2^3=27\) times the volume
