> recognise, continue and create repeating patterns with numbers, symbols, shapes and objects, identifying the repeating unit

Elaborations


- _AC9M1A02_E1_ - interpreting a repeating pattern sequence created by someone else, noticing and describing the repeating part of the pattern and explaining how they know what comes next in the sequence

- _AC9M1A02_E2_ - generalising a repeating pattern by identifying the unit of repeat and representing the elements using numbers, letters or symbols; for example, representing the repeating pattern of stamp, stamp, clap, stamp clap, stamp, stamp, clap, stamp, clap as SSCSC SSCSC SSCSC...  recognising the elements that are repeating, describing the unit of repeat as SSCSC and continuing the pattern

- _AC9M1A02_E3_ - recognising within the sequencing of natural numbers that \(0 – 9\) digits are repeated both in and between the decades and using this pattern to continue the sequence and name two-digit numbers beyond \(20\)

- _AC9M1A02_E4_ - identifying the repeating patterns in First Nations Australians’ systems of counting, exploring different ways of representing numbers including oral and gestural language

- _AC9M1A02_E5_ - considering how the making of shell or seed necklaces by First Nations Australians’ includes practices such as sorting shells and beads based on colour, size and shape, and creating a repeating pattern sequence
