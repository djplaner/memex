> measure the length of shapes and objects using informal units, recognising that units need to be uniform and used end-to-end

Elaborations


- _AC9M1M02_E1_ - using \(2\) different units; for example, pop sticks and pencils, to measure the length of an object such as a desk, and explaining why the number of units used may be different

- _AC9M1M02_E2_ - comparing the length of \(2\) objects such as a desk and a bookshelf by laying multiple copies of a unit and counting to say which is longer and how much longer; explaining why they shouldnâ€™t have gaps or overlaps between the units as this will change the length of the unit

- _AC9M1M02_E3_ - measuring the distance between \(2\) locations using footsteps, comparing the results and explaining why there may be different results; for example, referring to the different length of footsteps as using different units

- _AC9M1M02_E4_ - measuring and comparing the length of objects using blocks; for example, comparing the height of \(2\) toys by stacking blocks one on top of the other and counting how many it takes to reach the height of each object to decide which is taller
