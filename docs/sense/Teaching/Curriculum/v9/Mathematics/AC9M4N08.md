> use mathematical modelling to solve practical problems involving additive and multiplicative situations including financial contexts; formulate the problems using number sentences and choose efficient calculation strategies, using digital tools where appropriate; interpret and communicate solutions in terms of the situation

Elaborations


- _AC9M4N08_E1_ - modelling and solving a range of practical additive problems using materials, part-part-whole diagrams and/or a bar model, and writing addition and/or subtraction number sentences, based on whether a part or the whole is missing; explaining how each number in their number sentence is connected to the situation

- _AC9M4N08_E2_ - modelling practical problems with division, interpreting and representing the situation using a diagram or array to represent what is unknown (the number of groups, or the number per group); writing a division number sentence to represent the situation and choosing an efficient calculation strategy

- _AC9M4N08_E3_ - modelling practical problems involving money, such as a budget for a large event, as requiring either addition, subtraction, multiplication or division and justifying the choice of operation in relation to the situation

- _AC9M4N08_E4_ - modelling and solving multiplication problems involving money, such as buying \(5\) toy scooters for \(\$96\) each, using efficient mental strategies and written jottings to keep track if needed; for example, rounding \(\$96\) up to \(\$100\) and subtracting \(5 \times\$4 = \$20\), so \(5 \times\$96\) is the same as \(5\times\$100\) less \(\$20\), giving the answer \(\$500 \space–\space \$20 = \$480\)

- _AC9M4N08_E5_ - modelling situations by formulating comparison problems using number sentences, comparison models and arrays; for example, “Ariana read \(16\) books for the readathon; Maryam read \(4\) times as many books. How many books did Maryam read?” using the expression \(4 \times 16\) and using place value partitioning, basic facts and an array, thinking \(4 \times 10 = 40\) and \(4 \times 6 = 24\), so \(4 \times 16\) can be written as \(40 + 24 = 64\)
