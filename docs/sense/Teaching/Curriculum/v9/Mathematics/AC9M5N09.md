> use mathematical modelling to solve practical problems involving additive and multiplicative situations including financial contexts; formulate the problems, choosing operations and efficient calculation strategies, using digital tools where appropriate; interpret and communicate solutions in terms of the situation

Elaborations


- _AC9M5N09_E1_ - modelling an everyday situation and determining which operations can be used to solve it using materials, diagrams, arrays and/or bar models to represent the problem; formulating the situation as a number sentence and justifying their choice of operation in relation to the situation

- _AC9M5N09_E2_ - modelling a series of contextual problems, deciding whether an exact answer or an approximate calculation is appropriate; explaining their reasoning in relation to the context and the numbers involved

- _AC9M5N09_E3_ - modelling financial situations such as creating financial plans; for example, creating a budget for a class fundraising event, using a spreadsheet to tabulate data and perform calculations

- _AC9M5N09_E6_ - investigating how mathematical models involving combinations of operations can be used to represent songs, stories and/or dances of First Nations Australians
