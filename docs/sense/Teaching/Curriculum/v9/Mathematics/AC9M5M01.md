> choose appropriate metric units when measuring the length, mass and capacity of objects; use smaller units or a combination of units to obtain a more accurate measure

Elaborations


- _AC9M5M01_E1_ - ordering metric units from the largest unit to the smallest; for example, kilometre, metre, centimetre, millimetre

- _AC9M5M01_E2_ - recognising that some units of measurement are better suited to some tasks than others; for example, kilometres are more appropriate than metres to measure the distance between \(2\) towns

- _AC9M5M01_E3_ - deciding on the unit required to estimate the amount of paint or carpet for a room or a whole building; justifying the choice of unit in relation to the context and the degree of accuracy required

- _AC9M5M01_E4_ - measuring and comparing distances, such as jumps or throws using a metre length of string; for example, then measuring the part metre with centimetres and/or millimetres; explaining which unit of measure is most accurate

- _AC9M5M01_E5_ - researching how the base units are derived for the International System of Units (SI), commonly known as the metric system of units, recognising that the metric unit names for the attributes, length and mass are international standards for measurement
