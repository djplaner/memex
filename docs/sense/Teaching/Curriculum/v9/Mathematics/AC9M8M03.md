> solve problems involving the circumference and area of a circle using formulas and appropriate units

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M8M03_E1_ - deducing that the area of a circle is between \(2\) radius squares and \(4\) radius squares, and using \(3\times\)radius\(^2\) as a rough estimate for the area of a circle
	- _AC9M8M03_E2_ - investigating the area of circles using a square grid or by rearranging a circle divided into smaller and smaller sectors or slices to resemble a close approximation of a rectangle
	- _AC9M8M03_E3_ - applying the formulas for the area and circumference of a circle to solve practical problems, and using one of the measures of radius, diameter, circumference or area to deduce the value of the other measures; for example, determining the length of material needed to edge a round table, given its dimensions as the area of the tabletop
	- _AC9M8M03_E4_ - exploring traditional weaving designs by First Nations Australians and investigating the significance and use of circles
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT801_ - By the end of Year 8, students recognise irrational numbers and terminating or recurring decimals.
	- _ASMAT811_ - Students use formulas to solve problems involving the area and circumference of circles.
