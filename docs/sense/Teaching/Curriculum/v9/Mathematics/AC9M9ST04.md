	- _AC9M9ST04_E4_ - comparing and interpreting stacked bar charts, area charts and line graphs, discussing how they represent larger categories that can be subdivided into smaller categories and how information that can be obtained from these displays can be used for comparison
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT916_ - They compare and analyse the distributions of multiple numerical data sets, choose representations, describe features of these data sets using summary statistics and the shape of distributions, and consider the effect of outliers.
