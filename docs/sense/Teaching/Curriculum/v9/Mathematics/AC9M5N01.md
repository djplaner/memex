> interpret, compare and order numbers with more than 2 decimal places, including numbers greater than one, using place value understanding; represent these on a number line

Elaborations


- _AC9M5N01_E1_ - making models of decimals including tenths, hundredths and thousandths by subdividing materials or grids, and explaining the multiplicative relationship between consecutive places; for example, thousandths are \(10\) times smaller than hundredths; writing numbers into a place value chart to compare and order them

- _AC9M5N01_E2_ - renaming decimals to assist with mental computation; for example, when asked to solve \(0.6 ÷ 10\) they rename \(6\) tenths as \(60\) hundredths and say, “if I divide \(60\) hundredths by \(10\), I get \(6\) hundredths” and write \(0.6 ÷ 10 = 0.06\)

- _AC9M5N01_E3_ - using a number line or number track to represent and locate decimals with varying numbers of decimal places and numbers greater than one and justifying the placement; for example, \(2.335\) is halfway between \(2.33\) and \(2.34\); that is, \(2.33 < 2.335 < 2.34\) and \(5.283\) is between \(5.28\) and \(5.29\), but closer to \(5.28\)

- _AC9M5N01_E4_ - interpreting and comparing the digits in decimal measures; for example, the length or mass of animals or plants, such as a baby echidna weighing \(1.78\) kilograms and a platypus weighing \(1.708\) kilograms

- _AC9M5N01_E5_ - interpreting plans or diagrams showing length measures as decimals, placing the numbers into a decimal place value chart to connect the digits to their value
