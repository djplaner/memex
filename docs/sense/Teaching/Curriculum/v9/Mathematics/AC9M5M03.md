> compare 12- and 24-hour time systems and solve practical problems involving the conversion between them

Elaborations


- _AC9M5M03_E1_ - using timetables written in \(24\)-hour time, such as flight schedules, to plan an overseas or interstate trip, converting between \(24\)- and \(12\)-hour time

- _AC9M5M03_E2_ - converting between the digital and analog representation of \(24\)-hour time, matching the same times represented in both systems; setting the time on an analog watch using a digital alarm clock
