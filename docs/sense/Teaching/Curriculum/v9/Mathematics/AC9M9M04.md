> calculate and interpret absolute, relative and percentage errors in measurements, recognising that all measurements are estimates

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M9M04_E1_ - investigating error as a percentage of the exact value; for example, comparing an estimation of the number of people expected to come to an event by subtracting the actual number that turned up to give an error, then converting this into a percentage error
	- _AC9M9M04_E2_ - using absolute value in a percentage error formula; considering when they would use the absolute value and when they would not, depending upon the context
	- _AC9M9M04_E3_ - calculating the percentage errors in expected budgets to actual expenditure
	- _AC9M9M04_E4_ - estimating the accuracy of measurements in practical contexts and giving suitable lower and upper bounds for measurement values
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT910_ - They determine percentage errors in measurements.
