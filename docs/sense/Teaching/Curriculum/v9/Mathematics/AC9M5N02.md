> express natural numbers as products of their factors, recognise multiples and determine if one number is divisible by another

Elaborations


- _AC9M5N02_E1_ - using a certain number of blocks to form different rectangles and using these to list all possible factors for that number; for example, \(12\) blocks can form the following rectangles: \(1 \times 12, 2 \times 6\), and \(3 \times 4\)

- _AC9M5N02_E2_ - researching divisibility tests and explaining each rule using materials; for example, using base-\(10\) blocks to test if numbers are divisible by \(2, 5\) and \(10\)

- _AC9M5N02_E3_ - using divisibility tests to determine if larger numbers are multiples of one-digit numbers; for example, testing if \(89\) \(472\) is divisible by \(3\) using \(8 + 9 + 4 + 7 + 2=30\) as \(30\) is divisible by \(3\) then \(89\) \(472\) is a multiple of \(3\)

- _AC9M5N02_E4_ - demonstrating and reasoning that all multiples can be formed by combining or regrouping; for example, multiples of \(7\) can be formed by combining a multiple of \(2\) with the corresponding multiple of \(5\); \(3 \times 7 = 3 \times 2 + 3 \times 5\), and \(4 \times 7 = 4 \times 2 + 4 \times 5\)
