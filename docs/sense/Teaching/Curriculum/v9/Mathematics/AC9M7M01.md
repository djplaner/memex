> solve problems involving the area of triangles and parallelograms using established formulas and appropriate units

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M7M01_E1_ - using the formula for the area of a rectangle and the array structure to derive the formula for the area of a triangle and the area of a parallelogram , given their perpendicular heights; for example, establish that the area of a triangle is half the area of an appropriate rectangle by using the spatial relationship between rectangles and different types of triangles
	- _AC9M7M01_E2_ - using dynamic geometry software to demonstrate how the sliding of the vertex of a triangle at a fixed altitude opposite a side leaves the area of the triangle unchanged
	- _AC9M7M01_E3_ - using established formulas to solve practical problems involving the area of triangles, parallelograms and rectangles; for example, estimating the cost of materials needed to make shade sails based on a price per metre or determining different combinations of dimensions that lead to a given area
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT711_ - Students use formulas for the areas of triangles and parallelograms and the volumes of rectangular and triangular prisms to solve problems.
