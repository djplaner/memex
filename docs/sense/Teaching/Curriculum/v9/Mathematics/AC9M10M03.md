> solve practical problems applying Pythagoras’ theorem and trigonometry of right-angled triangles, including problems involving direction and angles of elevation and depression

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M10M03_E1_ - applying right-angled trigonometry to solve navigation problems involving bearings; for example, determining the bearing and estimating the distance of the final leg of an orienteering course
	- _AC9M10M03_E2_ - applying Pythagoras’ theorem and trigonometry to problems in surveying and design, where three-dimensional problems are decomposed into two-dimensional problems; for example, investigating the dimensions of the smallest box needed to package an object of a particular length
	- _AC9M10M03_E3_ - using a clinometer to measure angles of inclination, and applying trigonometry, and proportional reasoning to determine the height of buildings in practical contexts
	- _AC9M10M03_E4_ - applying Pythagoras’ theorem and trigonometry, and using dynamic geometric software, to design three-dimensional models of practical situations involving angles of elevation and depression; for example, modelling a crime scene
	- _AC9M10M03_E5_ - exploring navigation, design of technologies or surveying by First Nations Australians, investigating geometric and spatial reasoning, and how these connect to trigonometry
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT1001_ - By the end of Year 10, students recognise the effect of approximations of real  numbers in repeated calculations.
	- _ASMAT1007_ - Students apply Pythagoras’ theorem and trigonometry to solve practical problems involving right-angled triangles.
