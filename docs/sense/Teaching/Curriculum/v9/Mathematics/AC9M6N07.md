> solve problems that require finding a familiar fraction, decimal or percentage of a quantity, including percentage discounts, choosing efficient calculation strategies and using digital tools where appropriate

Elaborations


- _AC9M6N07_E1_ - explaining how \(\frac13\) of a quantity can be achieved by dividing by \(3\), and how knowledge of \(\frac13\) of a quantity can be used to find \(\frac23\) or \(\frac43\) of the same quantity using situations involving money, length, duration, mass or capacity

- _AC9M6N07_E2_ - investigating percentage discounts of \(15\)%, \(30\)% and \(45\)% in an online toy sale, using their equivalent decimal representations of \(0.15, 0.3\) and \(0.45\) to calculate the amount of discount on sale items, with and without digital tools

- _AC9M6N07_E3_ - linking percentages to their decimal equivalent of tenths and hundredths and using these to determine percentage discounts; for example, finding \(30\)% discount by using its equivalence to \(0.3\), dividing by \(10\) and multiplying the result by \(3\) to give \(30\)%

- _AC9M6N07_E4_ - explaining the equivalence between percentages and fractions; for example, \(33\frac13\)% and \(\frac13\); keeping to percentages that are equivalent to fractions with small denominators such as \(66\frac23\)% and \(12.5\)%

- _AC9M6N07_E5_ - representing a situation with a mathematical expression; for example, numbers and symbols such as \(\frac14\times24\), that involve finding a familiar fraction or percentage of a quantity; using mental strategies or a calculator and explaining the result in terms of the situation in question
