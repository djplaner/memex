> solve problems involving division, choosing efficient strategies and using digital tools where appropriate; interpret any remainder according to the context and express results as a whole number, decimal or fraction

Elaborations


- _AC9M5N07_E1_ - interpreting and solving everyday division problems such as, “How many buses are needed if there are \(436\) passengers, and each bus carries \(50\) people?”, deciding whether to round up or down in order to accommodate the remainder and justifying choices

- _AC9M5N07_E2_ - solving division problems mentally like \(72\) divided by \(9, 72 ÷ 9\), by thinking, “how many \(9\)s make \(72\)”, ? \(\times 9 = 72\) or “share \(72\) equally \(9\) ways”

- _AC9M5N07_E3_ - using the fact that equivalent division calculations result if both numbers are divided by the same factor
