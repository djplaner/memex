> solve one-variable linear equations with natural number solutions; verify the solution by substitution

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M7A03_E1_ - recognising that solving an equation is a process of determining a value that makes the equation true; using substitution to determine whether a given number is a solution to an equation or not
	- _AC9M7A03_E2_ - solving equations using concrete materials, the balance model, and backtracking, explaining the process
	- _AC9M7A03_E3_ - solving linear equations such as \(3x+7=19\) algebraically, and verifying the solution by substitution
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT708_ - They solve linear equations with natural number solutions.
