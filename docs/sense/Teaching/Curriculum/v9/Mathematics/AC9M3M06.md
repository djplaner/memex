> recognise the relationships between dollars and cents and represent money values in different ways

Elaborations


- _AC9M3M06_E1_ - investigating the relationship between dollars and cents, using physical or virtual materials to make different combinations of the same amount of money

- _AC9M3M06_E2_ - representing money amounts in different ways using knowledge of part-part-whole relationships; for example, knowing that \(\$1\) is equal to \(100\) cents; representing \(\$1.85\) as \(\$1 + 50\)c \(+ 20\)c\( + 10\)c \(+ 5\)c or \(50\)c \(+ 50\)c \(+ 50\)c \(+ 10\)c \(+ 10\)c \(+ 10\)c\( + 5\)c; when calculating change from buying an item for \(\$1.30\) from \(\$2\), starting from \(\$1.30\) add \(20\)c and \(50\)c which gives \(\$2\)

- _AC9M3M06_E3_ - representing money values in multiple ways when role-playing money transactions; for example, using play money to represent the coins and dollars you could use to pay for items
