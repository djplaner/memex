> recognise and extend the application of place value to tenths and hundredths and use the conventions of decimal notation to name and represent decimals

Elaborations


- _AC9M4N01_E1_ - using a bar to represent the whole, dividing it into \(10\) equal pieces with each piece representing \(0.1\) or a tenth of the whole length and understanding that \(2\) pieces are \(0.2\) or two-tenths of the whole

- _AC9M4N01_E2_ - using materials to show the multiplicative relationship between the whole, tenths and hundredths; for example, using a bundle of \(10\) straws to represent the whole, one straw as the tenth and cutting the tenth into \(10\) parts to show the hundredths; using “Decipipes” to represent tenths

- _AC9M4N01_E3_ - recognising that one is the same as ten-tenths and one-tenth is the same as \(10\) hundredths and using this relationship to rename decimals; for example, renaming \(0.25\) as two-tenths and five-hundredths or twenty-five hundredths

- _AC9M4N01_E4_ - making models of measurement attributes to show the relationship between the base unit and parts of the unit; for example, \(1.5\) metres is one metre and five-tenths of the next metre; \(1.75\) units is one unit and seventy-five hundredths of the next unit

- _AC9M4N01_E5_ - counting large quantities of mixed notes and coins, writing the total using dollars and cents, and recognising the cents as parts of the next dollar

- _AC9M4N01_E6_ - comparing the way money and measures are read and said, and explaining how they are the same and different; for example, \(\$2.75\) is said, “two dollars seventy-five” and \(2.75\) metres is said “two point seven five metres”; recognising that the \(7\) means seven-tenths and the \(5\) means five-hundredths in both
