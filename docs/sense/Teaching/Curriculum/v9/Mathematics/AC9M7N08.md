> recognise, represent and solve problems involving ratios

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M7N08_E1_ - using diagrams, physical or virtual materials to represent ratios, recognising that ratios express the quantitative relationship between 2 or more groups; for example, using counters or coloured beads to show the ratios \(1:4\) and \(1:1:2\)
	- _AC9M7N08_E2_ - using fractions to solve ratio problems involving comparison of quantities and considering part-part and part-whole relations; for example, dividing a set into the ratio \(1:2\) by determining the number of parts as \(3\)
	- _AC9M7N08_E3_ - sharing quantities in a given ratio; for example, sharing an amount of money in a given ratio, such as sharing \(\$20\) in the ratio \(2:3\)
	- _AC9M7N08_E4_ - applying ratios to realistic and meaningful contexts; for example, mixing \(500\) millilitres of a liquid with a concentration of \(1:4\) means \(\frac15\) concentrate and \(\frac45\) water so, \(0.2\) of \(500\) millilitres is concentrate and \(0.8\) of \(500\) millilitres is water; interpreting results in context
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT706_ - They use mathematical modelling to solve practical problems involving rational numbers, percentages and ratios, in financial and other applied contexts, justifying choices of representation.
