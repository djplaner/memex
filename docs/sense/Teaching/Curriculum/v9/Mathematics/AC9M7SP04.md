> design and create algorithms involving a sequence of steps and decisions that will sort and classify sets of shapes according to their attributes, and describe how the algorithms work

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M7SP04_E1_ - creating a classification scheme for triangles based on sides and angles, using a flow chart using sequences and decisions
	- _AC9M7SP04_E2_ - creating a flow chart or hierarchy for quadrilaterals that shows the relationships between trapeziums, parallelograms, rhombuses, rectangles, squares and kites
	- _AC9M7SP04_E3_ - creating a classification scheme for regular, irregular, concave or convex polygons that are sorted according to the number of sides
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT713_ - Students classify polygons according to their features and create an algorithm designed to sort and classify shapes.
