> partition and combine collections up to 10 using part-part-whole relationships and subitising to recognise and name the parts

Elaborations


- _AC9MFN04_E1_ - recognising numbers represented in physical or virtual ten-frames, and describing their reasoning: “It’s \(7\) because there is \(5\) there and \(2\) more”

- _AC9MFN04_E2_ - partitioning collections of up to \(10\) objects in different ways and saying the part-part-whole relationship; for example, partitioning a collection of \(6\) counters into \(4\) counters and \(2\) counters and saying, “\(6\) is \(4\) and \(2\) more, it’s \(2\) and \(4\)”, then partitioning the same collection into \(5\) and one or \(3\) and \(3\)

- _AC9MFN04_E3_ - representing part-part-whole relationships in numbers up to \(10\) using physical or virtual materials; for example, identifying numbers represented by dots in standard number configurations such as dominos and dice by recognising parts that form the whole

- _AC9MFN04_E4_ - exploring number groupings in First Nations Australians’ counting systems and the different ways of representing these groupings to form and partition numbers, applying this to quantify collections of objects in the environment on Country/Place up to \(10\)
