> describe relationships between variables represented in graphs of functions from authentic data

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M7A04_E1_ - using graphs to analyse a building’s electricity or gas usage over a period of time, the value of shares on a stock market, or the temperature during a day, interpreting and discussing the relationships they represent
	- _AC9M7A04_E2_ - using travel graphs to compare the distance travelled to and from school, interpreting and discussing features of travel graphs such as the slope of lines and the meaning of horizontal line segments
	- _AC9M7A04_E3_ - telling the story behind what is being represented in graphs of functions; for example, graphs representing pouring rates or distance versus time
	- _AC9M7A04_E4_ - using graphs of evaporation rates to explore and discuss First Nations Australians’ methods of water resource management
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT707_ - Students use algebraic expressions to represent situations, describe the relationships between variables from authentic data  and substitute values into formulas to determine unknown values.
