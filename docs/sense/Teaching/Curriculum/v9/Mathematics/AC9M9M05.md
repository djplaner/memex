> use mathematical modelling to solve practical problems involving direct proportion, rates, ratio and scale, including financial contexts; formulate the problems and interpret solutions in terms of the situation; evaluate the model and report methods and findings

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M9M05_E1_ - modelling situations involving direct proportion such as pro rata pay rates, exchange rates, multiple quotes for a job, conversion between scales or other appropriate science contexts; for example, Hooke’s law and other science contexts involving wave lengths and frequencies
	- _AC9M9M05_E2_ - modelling situations that impact on image editing used in social media and how proportion may not be maintained and can result in distorted images
	- _AC9M9M05_E3_ - modelling situations involving compliance with building and construction standards in design and construction, such as the rise and tread of staircases, and vertical and horizontal components of escalators
	- _AC9M9M05_E4_ - modelling situations involving the application of rates in practical contexts; for example, density, birth, flow or heartbeats
	- _AC9M9M05_E5_ - exploring fire techniques in land management practices used by First Nations Australians that use proportion relationships, including the rate of fire spread in different fuel types to wind speed, temperature and relative humidity
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT912_ - They use mathematical modelling to solve practical problems involving direct proportion, ratio and scale, evaluating the model and communicating their methods and findings.
