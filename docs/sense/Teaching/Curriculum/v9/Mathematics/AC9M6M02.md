> establish the formula for the area of a rectangle and use it to solve practical problems

Elaborations


- _AC9M6M02_E1_ - using one centimetre grid paper to construct a variety of rectangles, recording the side lengths and the related areas of the rectangles in a table to establish the formula for the area of a rectangle by recognising the relationship between the length of the sides and its calculated area

- _AC9M6M02_E2_ - using the relationship between the length and area of square units and the array structure to derive a formula for calculating the area of a rectangle from the lengths of its sides

- _AC9M6M02_E3_ - solving problems involving the comparison of lengths and areas using appropriate units

- _AC9M6M02_E4_ - investigating the connection between the perimeters of different rectangles with the same area and between the areas of rectangles with the same perimeter
