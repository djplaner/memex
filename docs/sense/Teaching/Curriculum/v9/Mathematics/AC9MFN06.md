Elaborations


- _AC9MFN06_E1_ - using materials to role-play equal sharing; for example, sharing pieces of fruit or a bunch of grapes between \(4\) people and discussing how you would know they have been shared equally; when playing card games where each player is dealt the same number of cards, and counting the number of cards after the deal to ensure they have the same amount

- _AC9MFN06_E2_ - representing situations that involve counting several items; for example, \(9\) beads or \(6\) \(\$1\) coins, and sharing them equally between \(3\) people by subitising or counting each group by ones to decide how many beads or coins each person will receive

- _AC9MFN06_E3_ - exploring instructive games of First Nations Australians that involve sharing; for example, playing Yangamini of the Tiwi Peoples of Bathurst Island to investigate and discuss equal sharing
