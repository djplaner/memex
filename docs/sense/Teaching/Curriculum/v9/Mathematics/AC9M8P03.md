> conduct repeated chance experiments and simulations, using digital tools to determine probabilities for compound events, and describe results

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M8P03_E1_ - using digital tools to conduct probability simulations involving compound events
	- _AC9M8P03_E2_ - using a random number generator and digital tools to simulate rolling \(2\) dice and calculating the difference between them, investigating what difference is likely to occur more often
	- _AC9M8P03_E3_ - using online simulation software to conduct probability simulations to determine in the long run if events are complementary
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT820_ - They conduct experiments and simulations using digital tools to determine related probabilities of compound events.
