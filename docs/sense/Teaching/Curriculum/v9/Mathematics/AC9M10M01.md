> solve problems involving the surface area and volume of composite objects using appropriate units

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M10M01_E1_ - determining the volumes and surface areas of composite solids, formed from a range of right prisms and cylinders, by considering the individual solids from which they are constructed
	- _AC9M10M01_E2_ - estimating the surface area and volume of composite objects in practical contexts
	- _AC9M10M01_E3_ - using mathematical modelling to provide solutions to problems involving surface area and volume; for example, ascertaining the rainfall that can be saved from a roof top and the optimal shape and dimensions for rainwater storage based on where it will be located on a property; determining whether to hire extra freezer space for the amount of ice cream required at a fundraising event for the school or community
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"
