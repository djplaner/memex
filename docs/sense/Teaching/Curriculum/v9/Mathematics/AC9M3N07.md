> follow and create algorithms involving a sequence of steps and decisions to investigate numbers; describe any emerging patterns

Elaborations


- _AC9M3N07_E1_ - following or creating an algorithm to generate number patterns formed by doubling and halving using technology to assist where appropriate; identifying and describing emerging patterns

- _AC9M3N07_E2_ - following or creating an algorithm that determines whether a given number is a multiple of \(2, 5\) or \(10\), identifying and discussing emerging patterns

- _AC9M3N07_E3_ - creating an algorithm as a set of instructions that a classmate can follow to generate multiples of \(3\) using the rule “To multiply by \( 3\) you double the number and add on one more of the number”; for example, for \(3\) threes you double \(3\) and add on \(3\) to get \(9\), for \(3\) fours you double \(4\) and add one more \(4\) to get \(12\) ...

- _AC9M3N07_E4_ - creating a sorting algorithm that will sort a collection of \(5\) cent and \(10\) cent coins and providing the total value of the collection by applying knowledge of multiples of \(5\) and \(10\)
