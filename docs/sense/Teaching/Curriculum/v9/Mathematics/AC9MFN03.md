> quantify and compare collections to at least 20 using counting and explain or demonstrate reasoning

Elaborations


- _AC9MFN03_E1_ - establishing the language and process of counting, understanding that each object must be counted only once, that the arrangement of objects does not affect how many there are, and that the last number counted answers the question of “How many?”; for example, saying numbers in sequence while playing and performing actions

- _AC9MFN03_E2_ - using counting to compare the size of two or more collections of like items to justify which collection contains more or less items

- _AC9MFN03_E3_ - using counting and one-to-one correspondence to quantify the number of items required for a purpose; for example, when asked to collect enough scissors for each member of their group to have a pair, counting each member and using the total count to know how many to collect

- _AC9MFN03_E4_ - discussing how different cultures may have alternative ways of representing the count; for example, discussing how people of the Asia region use an abacus or Chinese hand gestures

- _AC9MFN03_E5_ - using body-tallying that involves body parts and one-to-one correspondence from counting systems of First Nations Peoples of Australia, to count to \(20\)
