> locate positions in two-dimensional representations of a familiar space; move positions by following directions and pathways

Elaborations


- _AC9M2SP02_E1_ - interpreting maps of familiar places and identifying the position of key features

- _AC9M2SP02_E2_ - understanding that we use maps to receive and give directions and to describe place and spatial relationships between places

- _AC9M2SP02_E3_ - using a classroom seating plan to locate a new seating position and giving directions to other classmates to find their seats

- _AC9M2SP02_E4_ - following and creating movement instructions that need to be carried out to move through a \(4 \times 4\) grid mat on the classroom floor or on a computer screen; for example, one forward, \(2\) to the right and one backwards, and so on to reach a target square; using a robotic toy to follow a path on a street scene on a floor mat, adjusting their directions as they consider the order of their instructions, the direction and how far they want the toy to travel

- _AC9M2SP02_E5_ - moving around a two-dimensional maze using directional language to describe turns and changes in direction including saying, for example, “clockwise”, “anticlockwise”, “quarter turn to the left”, and “take the path to the right”
