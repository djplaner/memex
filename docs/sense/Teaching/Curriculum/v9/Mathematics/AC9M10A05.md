> experiment with functions and relations using digital tools, making and testing conjectures and generalising emerging patterns

Elaborations


- _AC9M10A05_E1_ - applying the graphing zoom functionality of digital tools and systematically refining intervals to identify approximate location of points of intersection of the graphs of \(2\) functions, such as \(x^2=2^x\)

- _AC9M10A05_E2_ - applying a bisection algorithm to determine the approximate location of the horizontal axis intercepts of the graph of a quadratic function such as \(f(x)=2x^2-3x-7\)

- _AC9M10A05_E3_ - applying transformations to the graph of \(x^2+y^2=1\)

- _AC9M10A05_E4_ - identifying the coordinates of any points of intersection of the graph of a linear function with the graph of a quadratic function or a circle

- _AC9M10A05_E5_ - identifying intervals on the real number line over which a given quadratic function is positive or negative

- _AC9M10A05_E6_ - using a table of values to determine when an exponential growth or decay function exceeds or falls below a given value, such as monitoring the trend in value of a share price in a context of exponential growth or decay
