> solve problems involving very small and very large measurements, time scales and intervals expressed in scientific notation

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M9M02_E1_ - representing very large and small real numbers in scientific notation, converting real numbers expressed in scientific notation into decimal form; for example, the approximate geological age of the earth is \(4.6\times 10^9\) years, the mass of a sugar molecule is \(5.68\times 10^{-21}\) grams
	- _AC9M9M02_E2_ - using knowledge of place value and applying exponent laws to operate with numbers expressed in scientific notation in applied contexts; for example, performing calculations involving extremely small numbers in scientific and other contexts
	- _AC9M9M02_E3_ - examining the degree of accuracy that different measurement instruments provide in a science laboratory, such as a measuring cylinder compared with a pipette, and recording data values to the correct degree of accuracy using appropriate scientific notation
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT913_ - Students express small and large numbers in scientific notation.
