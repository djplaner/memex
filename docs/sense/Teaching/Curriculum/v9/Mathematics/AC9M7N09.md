> use mathematical modelling to solve practical problems, involving rational numbers and percentages, including financial contexts; formulate problems, choosing representations and efficient calculation strategies, using digital tools as appropriate; interpret and communicate solutions in terms of the situation, justifying choices made about the representation

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M7N09_E1_ - modelling additive situations involving positive and negative quantities; for example, a lift travelling up and down floors in a high-rise apartment where the ground floor is interpreted as zero; in geography when determining altitude above and below sea level
	- _AC9M7N09_E2_ - modelling contexts involving proportion, such as the proportion of students attending the school disco, proportion of bottle cost to recycling refund, proportion of school site that is green space, 55% of Year 7 students attended the end of term function or 23% of the school population voted yes to a change of school uniform; interpreting and communicating answers in terms of the context of the situation
	- _AC9M7N09_E3_ - modelling financial problems involving profit and loss, credits and debits, gains and losses; for example, holding a fundraising sausage sizzle and determining whether the event made a percentage profit or loss
	- _AC9M7N09_E4_ - using mathematical modelling to investigate the proportion of land mass/area of Australian First Nations Peoples’ traditional grain belt compared with Australia’s current grain belt
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT706_ - They use mathematical modelling to solve practical problems involving rational numbers, percentages and ratios, in financial and other applied contexts, justifying choices of representation.
