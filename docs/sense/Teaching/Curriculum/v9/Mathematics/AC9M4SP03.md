> recognise line and rotational symmetry of shapes and create symmetrical patterns and pictures, using dynamic geometric software where appropriate

Elaborations


- _AC9M4SP03_E1_ - identifying rotational symmetry of shapes by tracing around various shapes and objects to create an image, and using the image to test and record which different rotations result in the same image

- _AC9M4SP03_E2_ - using dynamic geometric software to manipulate shapes and create symmetrical patterns; for example, creating tessellation patterns that are symmetrical

- _AC9M4SP03_E3_ - using stimulus materials such as the motifs in Central Asian textiles, Tibetan artefacts, Indian lotus designs and Islamic artwork to investigate and discuss line and rotational symmetry

- _AC9M4SP03_E4_ - exploring the natural environment on Country/Place to investigate and discuss patterns and symmetry of shapes and objects such as in flowers, plants and landscapes
