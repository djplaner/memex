> use mathematical modelling to solve practical problems involving additive and multiplicative situations including financial contexts; formulate problems using number sentences and choose calculation strategies, using digital tools where appropriate; interpret and communicate solutions in terms of the situation

Elaborations


- _AC9M3N06_E1_ - modelling practical additive situations, choosing whether to use an addition, subtraction or both when representing the problem as a number sentence, and explaining how each number in their number sentence is connected to the situation

- _AC9M3N06_E2_ - modelling additive problems using a bar model to represent the problem; for example, “I had \(75\) tomatoes and then picked some more, now I have \(138\). How many did I pick?”

- _AC9M3N06_E3_ - modelling practical multiplicative situations using materials or a diagram to represent the problem; for example, if \(4\) tomato plants each have \(6\) tomatoes, deciding whether to use an addition or multiplication number sentence, explaining how each number in their number sentence is connected to the situation

- _AC9M3N06_E4_ - modelling and solving practical  division problems involving unknown numbers of groups or finding how much is in each group by representing the problem with both division and multiplication number sentences; explaining how the \(2\) number sentences are connected to the problem

- _AC9M3N06_E5_ - modelling the problem of deciding how to share an amount equally; for example, \(48\) horses into \(2, 4, 6\) or \(8\) paddocks, representing the shares with a division and a multiplication number sentence, and counting the number in each share to check the solutions
