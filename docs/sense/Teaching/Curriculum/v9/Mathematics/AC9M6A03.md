> create and use algorithms involving a sequence of steps and decisions that use rules to generate sets of numbers; identify, interpret and explain emerging patterns

Elaborations


- _AC9M6A03_E1_ - using an algorithm to create extended number sequences involving rational numbers, using a rule and digital tools, explaining any emerging patterns

- _AC9M6A03_E2_ - designing an algorithm to model operations, using the concept of input and output, describing and explaining relationships and any emerging patterns; for example, using function machines to model operations and recognising and comparing additive and multiplicative relationships

- _AC9M6A03_E3_ - designing an algorithm or writing a simple program to generate a sequence of numbers based on the userâ€™s input and a chosen operation, discussing any emerging patterns; for example, generating a sequence of numbers and comparing how quickly the sequences are growing in comparison to each other using the rule adding \(2\) to the input number compared to multiplying the input number by \(2\)
