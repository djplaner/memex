> compare variations in distributions and proportions obtained from random samples of the same size drawn from a population and recognise the effect of sample size on this variation

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M8ST03_E1_ - comparing the proportion of students in favour of a proposal for a change in school uniform between different random samples of \(50\) students from the school population
	- _AC9M8ST03_E2_ - using digital tools to simulate repeated sampling of the same population, such as heights or arm spans of students, recording and comparing means, median and range of data between samples
	- _AC9M8ST03_E3_ - using relative frequencies from historical data to predict proportions and the likely number of outcomes in situations such as weather forecasting or the countries of origin of visitors to tourist attractions
	- _AC9M8ST03_E4_ - investigating the effect that adding or removing data from a data set has on measures of central tendency and spread
	- _AC9M8ST03_E5_ - investigating First Nations Ranger Groups and other groupsâ€™ use of sampling techniques to track biodiversity of species
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT816_ - They conduct statistical investigations and explain the implications of obtaining data through sampling.
	- _ASMAT818_ - They compare the variation in distributions of random samples of the same and different size from a given population with respect to shape, measures of central tendency and range.
