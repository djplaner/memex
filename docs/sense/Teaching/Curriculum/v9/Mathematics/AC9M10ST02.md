> compare data distributions for continuous numerical variables using appropriate data displays including boxplots; discuss the shapes of these distributions in terms of centre, spread, shape and outliers in the context of the data

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9M10ST02_E1_ - constructing and interpreting box plots and using them to compare data sets, understanding that box plots are an efficient and common way of representing and summarising data and can facilitate comparisons between data sets
	- _AC9M10ST02_E2_ - comparing shapes of distributions using box plots, histograms, cumulative frequency graphs and dot plots, discussing symmetry, skew and modality
	- _AC9M10ST02_E3_ - using digital tools to compare boxplots and histograms as displays of the same data in the light of the statistical questions being addressed and the effectiveness of the display in helping to answer the question
	- _AC9M10ST02_E4_ - finding the five-number summary (minimum and maximum values, median, and upper and lower quartiles) and using its graphical representation, the box plot, as tools for both numerically and visually comparing the centre and spread of data sets
	- _AC9M10ST02_E5_ - comparing the information that can be extracted and the stories that can be told about continuous and discrete numerical data sets that have been displayed in different ways, including histograms, dot plots, box plots and cumulative frequency graphs
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASMAT1015_ - Students compare the distribution of continuous numerical  data  using  various displays, and discuss distributions in terms of centre, spread, shape and outliers.
