> generate and communicate design ideas and decisions using appropriate attributions, technical terms and graphical representation techniques, including using digital tools

Elaborations


- _AC9TDE4P02_E1_ - visualising innovative design ideas by producing thumbnail sketches, models and labelled drawings to explain features and modifications, for example drawing one or more designs for a machine to collect waste, and including labels and descriptions to explain materials used, their properties and the intended function of components or the whole system

- _AC9TDE4P02_E2_ - planning, sharing and documenting creative designs, ideas and processes using digital tools and appropriate terms and privacy considerations, for example a class blog or collaborative document that has been selectively shared with peers

- _AC9TDE4P02_E3_ - communicating design ideas using annotated diagrams, for example labelling a diagram for a pushcart with technical terms and explanations about components such as the chassis, axle, wheels and steering

- _AC9TDE4P02_E4_ - generating design ideas for solutions using Safety by Design principles, for example designing communication that is accessible for all parents and carers
