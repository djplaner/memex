> analyse and make judgements on how the sensory and functional properties of food influence the design and preparation of sustainable food solutions for healthy eating

Elaborations


- _AC9TDE10K05_E1_ - analysing how First Nations Australians have long understood techniques to turn plant products into food sources with high nutritional value, for example throughout much of northern Australia, cycad nuts have been detoxified to prepare them for safe consumption

- _AC9TDE10K05_E2_ - experimenting with food preservation methods such as freezing and dehydrating to determine changes to food structure and how these impact on designing healthy food solutions, for example dehydrating fruit for a lunchbox

- _AC9TDE10K05_E3_ - conducting sensory and nutritional assessment testing of a range of foods to determine how these characteristics might be used to enhance food solutions, for example taste-testing a variety of milks, comparing freshly squeezed juice with commercial juices or locally grown fruit with imported fruit

- _AC9TDE10K05_E4_ - determining how the causes of food spoilage can be addressed when preparing, cooking, presenting and storing food items, for example developing a comprehensive checklist of considerations for safe and hygienic food storage and preparation including danger-zone temperatures for a food service

- _AC9TDE10K05_E5_ - reflecting on food trends and how they may influence choosing food or designing food solutions for healthy eating, for example choosing organic ingredients or plant-based foods to reduce environmental impact, food delivery systems, insect protein or non-dairy milk or virtual cooking classes 

- _AC9TDE10K05_E6_ - investigating ways innovations may influence human health and sustainability, for example 3D printing of foods, Internet of Things (IoT) network in the food supply chain or use of augmented reality (AR) in food labelling

- _AC9TDE10K05_E7_ - considering factors that influence the preparation and presentation of foods using a range of techniques to ensure optimum nutrient content, flavour, texture and visual appeal, for example designing and producing a healthy snack for the canteen and using food photography and digital tools to promote the item in a healthy eating campaign
