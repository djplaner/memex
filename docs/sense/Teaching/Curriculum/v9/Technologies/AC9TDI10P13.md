> develop cyber security threat models, and explore a software, user or software supply chain vulnerability

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9TDI10P13_E1_ - using a data flow diagram to understand how private information moves through a system and when it would be the most likely target of a cyber attack, for example mapping how data moves between the user and server when using a web application, and identifying that sending the data in plaintext would make it susceptible to a man-in-the-middle attack
	- _AC9TDI10P13_E2_ - exploring the impact of a cyber security threat by systematically following the steps involved in bypassing a known vulnerability in their own software, for example manually changing the value stored in a login cookie to that of another user to observe the impact of unauthorised access on the system
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASTECTDI91004_ - Students explain how digital systems manage, control and secure access to data; and model cyber security threats and explore a vulnerability.
