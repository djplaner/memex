> analyse how force, motion and energy are used to manipulate and control engineered systems

Elaborations


- _AC9TDE8K03_E1_ - analysing how wind turbines harness the motion of propellers to transform wind energy into electricity, and how this energy is used to sustainably power communities classified as remote, such as on Waiben (Thursday Island) in the Torres Strait Islands and in Gawa on Elcho Island near the northern Arnhem Land coast

- _AC9TDE8K03_E2_ - investigating the technologies in a control system for an identified need or opportunity and user, for example the Corriong or Millowl (Phillip Island) penguin weighbridge that enables collection of data about penguin weight and foraging duration

- _AC9TDE8K03_E3_ - experimenting to select the most appropriate principles and systems on which to base design ideas, for example testing structural components for strength

- _AC9TDE8K03_E4_ - testing functionality of an idea by producing prototypes and jigs, including the use of rapid prototyping tools such as 3D printers

- _AC9TDE8K03_E5_ - calculating an engineered systemâ€™s outputs, for example speed, brightness of light, volume of sound to determine when the system might fail

- _AC9TDE8K03_E6_ - experimenting with control systems to understand motion, for example programming a microcontroller or an object-based programming application to control a system such as a remote-controlled car or robotic arm

- _AC9TDE8K03_E7_ - investigating components, tools and equipment in terms of force, motion or energy, for example testing the durability of batteries or determining the effective range of wireless devices
