> implement algorithms as visual programs involving control structures, variables and input

Elaborations


- _AC9TDI6P05_E1_ - writing and editing programs to solve problems using branching, iteration and variables in a visual programming environment, for example writing a program to draw a rotated shape a given number of times using Turtle Graphics

- _AC9TDI6P05_E2_ - writing programs that take input from the user or environment and storing that input in a variable for later use, for example asking the user how many shapes to draw in a circle and using that to calculate the number of iterations and angle to rotate each time

- _AC9TDI6P05_E3_ - writing programs that make decisions involving multiple alternatives, for example an interactive quiz that checks if the answer is correct, gives feedback and updates the score, or gives a final grade based on the score

- _AC9TDI6P05_E4_ - writing programs that repeat multiple steps based on the user's input, for example repeatedly drawing a shape a given number of times, shifting the position between each iteration

- _AC9TDI6P05_E5_ - stating the expected behaviour of a program, running the program to check it is correct and fixing any errors, for example 'when I press the left arrow key, the cat should move left, finding the cat moves right, and fixing it by changing the 10 to -10 to alter the direction'

- _AC9TDI6P05_E6_ - programming digital systems to perform automated tasks, such as closing gates, for example simulating the work of First Nations Australian rangers attempting to lure and capture feralâ€¯animals
