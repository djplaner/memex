> define and decompose real-world problems with design criteria and by creating user stories

Elaborations


- _AC9TDI8P04_E1_ - framing a problem in terms of what we know, why it is important and the outcome we want, for example matching the items in your fridge to possible recipes to reduce food waste

- _AC9TDI8P04_E2_ - asking a series of questions and sub-questions to understand the problem and breaking it down into manageable parts, for example “How do we keep track of what items are in the pantry? Are there any dietary requirements that need to be considered?”

- _AC9TDI8P04_E3_ - using a template such as "As a <type of user>, I want <some goal> so that <some reason>", for example "As a user with a visual impairment I want to be able to get the news on my smartphone so that I can keep up with my world"

- _AC9TDI8P04_E4_ - making predictions about future population distribution of First Nations Australians based on identified trends, for example analysing and visualising data using spreadsheets and databases on their population growth in metropolitan areas
