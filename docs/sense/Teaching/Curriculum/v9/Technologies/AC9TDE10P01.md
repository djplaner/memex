> analyse needs or opportunities for designing; develop design briefs; and investigate, analyse and select materials, systems, components, tools and equipment to create designed solutions

Elaborations


- _AC9TDE10P01_E1_ - analysing First Nations Australians’ traditional grains for their potential for providing nutritional and commercial solutions and developing a design brief to highlight the materials, systems, components and tools or equipment needed

- _AC9TDE10P01_E2_ - analysing the design of new products to identify how well design ideas respond to sustainability issues, for example swimming pool covers, ultraviolet lights and lamps for disinfection, or disposable household products

- _AC9TDE10P01_E3_ - developing design briefs that take into consideration the needs of users, for example considering universal design principles or Safety by Design principles to improve accessibility and safety

- _AC9TDE10P01_E4_ - analysing a range of design and technologies ideas, for example assessing those that draw on the intellectual property of others, including Indigenous cultural and intellectual property rights

- _AC9TDE10P01_E5_ - considering the needs of community groups to identify rich design tasks, for example interviewing community members about accessibility requirements to develop the initial brief and then during specific phases of the design process to determine the best possible designed solution for the community

- _AC9TDE10P01_E6_ - examining tools, techniques, equipment and relationships of properties for complementary materials for product development, for example examining compressive and tensile strengths of materials
