> investigate needs or opportunities for designing, and the materials, components, tools, equipment and processes needed to create designed solutions

Elaborations


- _AC9TDE6P01_E1_ - investigating First Nations Australians’ traditional fibre sources as potential commercial solutions for biodegradable string or rope, and researching the materials, systems, components, tools and equipment needed

- _AC9TDE6P01_E2_ - surveying people in the school community about their needs in order to design an appropriate product, service or environment that addresses the need, for example planning the requirements for a community meal, creating more shade in the school by determining where trees could be planted or designing a security system for the community garden

- _AC9TDE6P01_E3_ - investigating designed solutions from around the world to make suitable, quality decisions that meet needs or opportunities, for example locating information online about small-space gardening ideas from different countries and judging their suitability for the local environment

- _AC9TDE6P01_E4_ - investigating the importance of complementary parts of working systems by deconstructing the components, structure and purpose of products, services or environments, for example labelling a diagram of a robotic weeder or vacuum cleaner and explaining the function of parts

- _AC9TDE6P01_E5_ - testing a range of materials, components, tools and equipment to determine the appropriate technologies needed to make products, services or environments, for example the materials for a product such as a rubber-band-powered vehicle or item of protective clothing

- _AC9TDE6P01_E6_ - investigating how to minimise material use and manage waste by comparing the environmental and social impacts of materials, components, tools and equipment, for example comparing the cost and environmental impact of repurposing an old item of clothing to create a carry bag with buying a new one, or using vegetable scraps to make a healthy soup versus buying takeaway soup
