> generate, iterate and communicate design ideas, decisions and processes using technical terms and graphical representation techniques, including using digital tools

Elaborations


- _AC9TDE6P02_E1_ - generating a range of design ideas for products, services or environments using prior knowledge, skills and research, for example a security system for a community garden, a product made from a repurposed item of clothing, a permaculture vegetable patch or a healthy meal for a family picnic

- _AC9TDE6P02_E2_ - analysing, modifying and developing design ideas to enhance and improve the sustainability of the product, service, environment or system, for example analysing eco-friendly alternatives to non-recyclable decorations for a community event or replacing paper-based newsletters with onlineâ€¯formats

- _AC9TDE6P02_E3_ - representing and communicating design ideas using modelling and drawing standards including the use of digital tools, for example including scale, symbols and codes in plans and diagrams; using pictorial maps and aerial views; and using digital mapping applications or infographics to present research and ideas to others

- _AC9TDE6P02_E4_ - developing and using models to iterate and improve design ideas, for example using modelling applications to design the layout and features of an enclosure for a chosen animal

- _AC9TDE6P02_E5_ - experimenting with materials, tools and equipment to refine design decisions and processes, for example considering the selection of materials and joining techniques to suit the purpose of a product, such as a pop-up book, a fabric bag or an electric circuit

- _AC9TDE6P02_E6_ - considering the social values and ethics of clients when designing an environment, for example interviewing users of a space or seeking permission to use designs or images created by others including respect of cultural and intellectual property
