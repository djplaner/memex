Elaborations


- _AC9TDE8P01_E1_ - considering First Nations Australian community needs when identifying opportunities for designing, for example considering the needs of local groups when designing energy supply or community housing solutions in areas classified as remote

- _AC9TDE8P01_E2_ - considering community needs when identifying opportunities for designing, for example gardens for a community centre, cost-effective food service for a sport club

- _AC9TDE8P01_E3_ - experimenting with traditional and contemporary technologies when developing designs, and discovering the advantages and disadvantages of each approach, for example comparing a hand-sewn product with one produced using a sewing machine

- _AC9TDE8P01_E4_ - investigating emerging technologies and their potential impact on design decisions, for example flame-retardant fabrics, self-healing materials, virtual reality or aquaponics

- _AC9TDE8P01_E5_ - examining, testing and selecting a variety of suitable materials, components, tools and equipment for each design project, for example the durability differences between natural hardwood and plantation softwood timbers, which determine their suitability for interior or exterior use

- _AC9TDE8P01_E6_ - analysing the viability of using different techniques and materials in areas considered remote, isolated areas or less developed countries and selecting appropriate materials to acknowledge sustainability needs by using life cycle thinking

- _AC9TDE8P01_E7_ - creating a survey to determine studentsâ€™ food choices and developing a range of healthy food items such as snacks, juices, breakfast or nourish bowls such as a Buddha bowl which could be sold at the school canteen
