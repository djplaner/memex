> develop design criteria independently including sustainability to evaluate design ideas, processes and solutions

Elaborations


- _AC9TDE10P04_E1_ - establishing specific design criteria for evaluating designed solutions, for example determining necessary function of a product, service or environment such as an acceptable load for an engineered structure to carry and making a judgement about whether these have been met after stress testing or user testing

- _AC9TDE10P04_E2_ - evaluating and justifying the use and best combination of traditional, contemporary and emerging technologies during project development, including consideration of sustainability, for example considering farming methods that improve soil quality including those methods used in South-Eastâ€¯Asia

- _AC9TDE10P04_E3_ - reflecting on learning including processes or choices made at various stages of a design process and modifying plans when needed with consideration of design criteria

- _AC9TDE10P04_E4_ - responding creatively to evaluation feedback to iterate and modify design ideas and processes to improve sustainability measures, for example considering opportunities to use sustainable materials, such as plant-based timber oils or bioplastics
