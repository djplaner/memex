> examine design and technologies occupations and factors including sustainability that impact on the design of products, services and environments to meet community needs

Elaborations


- _AC9TDE4K01_E1_ - exploring how many First Nations Australians were and continue to be recognised for their specialist skills in designing and producing products made from local materials and providing related services, using sustainable practices to ensure future access to meet community needs, for example traditional adhesives

- _AC9TDE4K01_E2_ - exploring how design and technologies occupations in the local area (urban, suburban, regional or rural) meet community needs, for example bakers, builders, engineers, farmers, seafood industry workers, mechanics, radiographers, textile designers and others in science, technology, engineering and mathematics roles

- _AC9TDE4K01_E3_ - examining the suitability of a service or system and proposing improvements, for example a water-saving system for a bathroom at home or school, traffic management systems to reduce traffic jams around the school, remote and regional services including medical services

- _AC9TDE4K01_E4_ - exploring how Australian designers consider sustainability when designing products, services or environments, for example designing products from 100% recycled materials, designing services that use minimal energy, or designing landscapes that require minimal water

- _AC9TDE4K01_E5_ - examining products and environments to discover the factors that may have influenced the design and, choice of technologies used, for example discussing energy-efficient cooking with a wok, or sustainable wood products for home use including furniture made from plantation timbers, bamboo toothbrushes or coconut shell bowls

- _AC9TDE4K01_E6_ - conducting a survey to identify a community need that involves accessibility and social sustainability, for example design features that improve access to the school
