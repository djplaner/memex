> investigate how data is transmitted and secured in wired and wireless networks including the internet

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9TDI8K02_E1_ - describing physical networks and comparing their properties, for example the bandwidth, latency and reliability of wired versus wireless networks
	- _AC9TDI8K02_E2_ - explaining why cryptography is necessary for securing data, for example transmitting credit card details over the internet
	- _AC9TDI8K02_E3_ - exploring simple encryption and decryption algorithms, for example ROT13 and XOR
	- _AC9TDI8K02_E4_ - explaining how problems occur in network communication and how they can be solved, for example routers can drop packets and how Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) uses acknowledgements to confirm packets have been received
