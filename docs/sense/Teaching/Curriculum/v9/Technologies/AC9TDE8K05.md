> analyse how properties of foods determine preparation and presentation techniques when designing solutions for healthy eating

Elaborations


- _AC9TDE8K05_E1_ - analysing how First Nations Australians prepare foods for healthy eating, for example using cooking methods that improve edibility, such as removing bitterness to make yams more palatable, roasting bunya nuts to improve texture and flavour, and on many occasions, carefully selecting wood for roasting and smoking to complement the flavour of foods

- _AC9TDE8K05_E2_ - explaining how food preparation techniques impact on the sensory properties, such as flavour, appearance, texture and aroma of food, for example the browning of cut fruit, the absorption of water when cooking rice, and the selection of timbers when smoking foods

- _AC9TDE8K05_E3_ - investigating the relationship between food preparation techniques and the impact on nutrient value including how a recipe can be modified to enhance health benefits, for example stir-frying, steaming vegetables, leaving skin on vegetables or removing skin from chicken

- _AC9TDE8K05_E4_ - analysingÂ food preparation techniques used in different cultures including those from countries across Asia and the impact of these on nutrient retention, aesthetics, taste and palatability, for example stir-frying, steaming, poaching and using a wide variety of vegetables
