> examine how digital systems form networks to transmit data

Elaborations


- _AC9TDI6K02_E1_ - explaining how separate systems can be connected in different ways to exchange data, for example how a laptop can be connected to a network via a cable or radio waves

- _AC9TDI6K02_E2_ - describing the way data is structured and transmitted through a network, for example broken up into packets (small pieces) and passed from the source, through multiple devices, to the destination

- _AC9TDI6K02_E3_ - investigating the use of satellite phones where mobile phone networks are not available, inaccessible or unreliable, for example many homeland communities of Arnhem Land have limited access to mainstream communication networks
