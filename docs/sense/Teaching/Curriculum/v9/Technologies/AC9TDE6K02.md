Elaborations


- _AC9TDE6K02_E1_ - investigating how automated, labour-saving photovoltaic systems are expected to provide opportunities for First Nations Australians to expand their aquaculture industries in coastal regions of northern Australia

- _AC9TDE6K02_E2_ - explaining how sun tracking of solar panels assists renewable energy production in communities classified as remote

- _AC9TDE6K02_E3_ - describing the process needed to carefully plan and select components for a system to perform a specific task, for example planning the arrangement of switches, light globes and a power source in a lighting design

- _AC9TDE6K02_E4_ - producing models using materials, tools and equipment to show how to control movement, sound or light, for example constructing an automation or lifting system including a pulley to raise a bucket or toy

- _AC9TDE6K02_E5_ - deconstructing a product or system to discover how movement, sound or light can be controlled, for example taking apart a torch or buzzer, or exploring circuit design in a security system and investigating the properties of materials to solve problems including the amount of light reflected from different surfaces to control a sensor
