> define problems with given design criteria and by co-creating user stories

Elaborations


- _AC9TDI4P01_E1_ - recognising a range of familiar problems and defining achievable solutions using given design criteria, for example buying presents for family members within a specified budget

- _AC9TDI4P01_E2_ - using responses to guiding questions to write a user story, for example a family member wants a way of entertaining their puppy when they are at school to stop it digging holes

- _AC9TDI4P01_E3_ - co-creating a user story using a template such as ‘A <type of user> has <some goal> so that <some reason>’, for example ‘a sports team wants to access league rankings online so that they can see their progress’

- _AC9TDI4P01_E4_ - developing a problem statement for collecting and managing information, for example how First Nations Australians rangers could monitor animal populations, such as local marine turtles, using global positioning systems (GPS)

- _AC9TDI4P01_E5_ - co-creating user stories about exploring hard-to-reach locations, for example a school student wants to explore neighbouring countries classified as remote to compare how people live
