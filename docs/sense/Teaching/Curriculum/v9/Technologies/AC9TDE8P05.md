> develop project plans to individually and collaboratively manage time, cost and production of designed solutions

Elaborations


- _AC9TDE8P05_E1_ - interpreting drawings to plan resources and production steps needed to produce products, services or environments for specific purposes, for example identifying resource requirements from specifications on a labelled drawing and collaboratively developing a detailed procedure

- _AC9TDE8P05_E2_ - identifying risks and how to minimise them, organising time, evaluating decisions and managing resources to ensure successful project completion, for example using digital tools to keep track of tasks, resources, expenses and deadlines

- _AC9TDE8P05_E3_ - investigating the time needed for each step of production, for example estimating time allocations on a planning template for the different stages of the design process needed to produce a clock, acoustic speaker or desk lamp using prior knowledge, research and testing
