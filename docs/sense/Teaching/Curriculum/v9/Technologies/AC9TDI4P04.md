> implement simple algorithms as visual programs involving control structures and input

Elaborations


- _AC9TDI4P04_E1_ - writing and editing programs to solve simple problems using branching and simple iteration in a visual programming environment, for example helping a user understand multiplication by displaying the repeated addition in order

- _AC9TDI4P04_E2_ - writing programs that take input from the user or environment, for example asking the user for their name and displaying it or sensing the temperature from the environment to make a decision

- _AC9TDI4P04_E3_ - writing programs that make decisions involving comparison, for example comparing whether the temperature is above 25 degrees Celsius to label the weather hot or cold

- _AC9TDI4P04_E4_ - writing programs that repeat one or more steps a fixed number of times, for example writing a program that displays repetitive song lyrics, such as in ‘Ten in the bed’

- _AC9TDI4P04_E5_ - running and testing a program to check it performs as expected, for example a character: 1. moves forward 2. turns left 3. moves forward

- _AC9TDI4P04_E6_ - implementing a program that demonstrates the strict routines and techniques followed by First Nations Australian ranger groups when caring for or handling specific native animals, for example using IF and THEN statements to create a training manual, such as: IF <insert animal name> is injured THEN the ranger will <insert action>
