> apply innovation and enterprise skills to generate, test, iterate and communicate design ideas, processes and solutions, including using digital tools

Elaborations


- _AC9TDE10P02_E1_ - using techniques including combining and modifying ideas and exploring functionality to generate solution concepts and reimagining designs to feature emerging technologies, for example designing wearable technology that could help or give independence to elderly people, such as wearable blood glucose monitors

- _AC9TDE10P02_E2_ - undertaking functional, structural and aesthetic analysis of benefits and constraints of design ideas, for example assessing how a design is suitable for different communities and environments including a country in Asia, for example the design of skyscrapers in Japan to withstand earthquakes

- _AC9TDE10P02_E3_ - considering competing variables that may hinder or enhance project development, for example weight, strength and price of materials; laws; sustainability; accessibility; social protocols, user needs and community consultation processes

- _AC9TDE10P02_E4_ - producing drawings, models and prototypes to explore design ideas, for example using technical drawing techniques (for example perspective and orthogonal drawings), digital imaging programs, 3D printers or augmented reality (AR) modelling software; producing multiple prototypes that show an understanding of key aesthetic considerations in competing designs

- _AC9TDE10P02_E5_ - communicating using appropriate technical terms and recording the generation and development of design ideas and processes for an intended audience including justification of decisions, for example developing a digital portfolio with images and text which clearly communicate each step of a design process

- _AC9TDE10P02_E6_ - using design thinking and enterprise skills to create innovative approaches to processes and solutions, for example brainstorming novel ideas inspired by nature or transforming a solution into an enterprise for a target market
