> analyse and visualise data interactively using a range of software, including spreadsheets and databases, to draw conclusions and make predictions by identifying trends and outliers

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9TDI10P02_E1_ - summarising data, its attributes and the relationships between data sets, identifying trends and outliers to draw conclusions and make predictions, for example summarising data about electorates and their demographics, historical swings and exceptions to predict an election outcome
	- _AC9TDI10P02_E2_ - developing interactive visualisations for exploring complex data, for example population, life expectancy and fertility rate in motion charts
	- _AC9TDI10P02_E3_ - using software to visualise and compare data to identify patterns, relationships and trends, for example investigating emerging trends in Australia's industries
	- _AC9TDI10P02_E4_ - exploring machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence where an algorithm is trained using a data set, for example to classify images into categories
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASTECTDI91002_ - Students acquire, interpret and model complex data with databases and represent documents as content, structure and presentation.
