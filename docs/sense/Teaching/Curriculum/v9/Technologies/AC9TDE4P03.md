> select and use materials, components, tools, equipment and techniques to safely make designed solutions

Elaborations


- _AC9TDE4P03_E1_ - exploring ways of joining, connecting and assembling components that ensure success including the impact digital tools have on these processes, for example using virtual reality or simulations to experience assembling materials or using tools

- _AC9TDE4P03_E2_ - using tools and equipment accurately when measuring, marking and cutting, for example when creating a template or pattern, measuring ingredients in a recipe or preparing a garden bed for sowing seeds

- _AC9TDE4P03_E3_ - explaining the importance of safe, responsible, inclusive and cooperative work practices when designing and making, for example when handling sharp equipment such as knives and scissors

- _AC9TDE4P03_E4_ - selecting and using materials, components, tools, equipment and processes with consideration of the environmental impact at each stage of the production process, for example considering how packaging and offcuts could be recycled or used for other purposes before choosing materials for a project

- _AC9TDE4P03_E5_ - using appropriate technologies terms to describe and share with other students the procedures and techniques for making, for example how to safely make an engineered solution such as a robotic device
