> analyse and make judgements on how the characteristics and properties of materials are combined with force, motion and energy to control engineered systems

Elaborations


- _AC9TDE10K03_E1_ - investigating the engineering innovations of First Nations Australians, such as spearthrowers and bow and arrow, and how the characteristics and properties of materials are used, such as rigidity, flexibility and hardness

- _AC9TDE10K03_E2_ - explaining the way common machines or engineered systems interact and combine properties of materials, force, motion and energy efficiently, for example examining the structure and function of cranes on building sites or in a system, or examining the structure and function of car safety features such as seatbelts, airbags and crumple zones

- _AC9TDE10K03_E3_ - calculating forces, reactions and loads in structures and analysing the relationship between materials of properties, forces and safety in engineered systems such as bridges

- _AC9TDE10K03_E4_ - critiquing the effectiveness of the combinations of materials, forces, energy and motion in an engineered system such as a 3D printer

- _AC9TDE10K03_E5_ - investigating how the placement of wind turbines in a wind farm affects their performance, for example designing a layout to maximise the productivity of a wind farm within a given space

- _AC9TDE10K03_E6_ - investigating the main types of chargers for electric vehicles (EV) and their capabilities, for example making a recommendation for the best charger for an EV owner who uses their vehicle for commuting to work
