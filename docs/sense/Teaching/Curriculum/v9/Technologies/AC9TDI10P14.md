> apply the Australian Privacy Principles to critique and manage the digital footprint that existing systems and student solutions collect

Elaborations


- _AC9TDI10P14_E1_ - critiquing the extent to which online services allow them to control access to their data in line with the Australian Privacy Principles, for example assessing whether their social media accounts allow them to update their contact information if these details change, and who else can see that information on the platform

- _AC9TDI10P14_E2_ - using the Australian Privacy Principles as a reference to evaluate the steps they are taking to protect user information in their application, for example explaining how they are storing passwords using cryptographic hashing algorithms so that a data breach does not expose their users to security vulnerabilities due to password re-use
