> explain how and why food and fibre are produced in managed environments

Elaborations


- _AC9TDE6K03_E1_ - exploring how before colonisation, First Nations Australians lived in discrete communities that cared for, protected and sustainably harvested food and fibre resources, some of which are now cultivated to meet domestic and international demand, for example bunya nuts, macadamia and finger limes

- _AC9TDE6K03_E2_ - investigating and experimenting with different tools, equipment and methods of preparing soil and the effect on soil quality and sustainability including conserving and recycling nutrients, for example building a food composting system, including mulch when designing a sustainable school vegetable garden or cropping area

- _AC9TDE6K03_E3_ - describing the relationship between plant types and animal breeds and their environmental suitability when selecting suitable plants or animals for an environment, for example growing tropical fruits in northern Australia due to higher temperature, and raising sheep in the cooler regions of Australia

- _AC9TDE6K03_E4_ - sequencing the process of converting on-farm food or fibre products into a product suitable for retail sale, for example creating a digital flowchart to record a paddock-to-plate supply chain, or the fibre-to-garment life cycle (fibre, yarn, fabric, garment)

- _AC9TDE6K03_E5_ - visiting a farm or participating in a virtual tour to ask questions about how and why food and fibre are produced in that environment
