> use given or co-developed design criteria including sustainability to evaluate design ideas and solutions

Elaborations


- _AC9TDE4P04_E1_ - developing design criteria with others including considering universal design principles to address social sustainability, for example a criterion that specifies flexible or intuitive use or low physical effort

- _AC9TDE4P04_E2_ - using design criteria to evaluate, revise and select design ideas, for example when designing an e-textile toy for a young child to ensure it will be safe

- _AC9TDE4P04_E3_ - comparing the amount of waste that would be produced from different design ideas and the potential for recycling waste, for example exploring the choice of materials to construct a toy and whether these materials are repairable or able to be recycled once the toy breaks or is no longer wanted

- _AC9TDE4P04_E4_ - reflecting on how well their designed solution meets design criteria, such as ensuring safety and wellbeing of users and meeting the needs of communities or different cultures, for example reviewing and discussing the choice of fabrics used to make re-usable bags and how they could be made more appealing to all cultural groups by considering modifications to style
