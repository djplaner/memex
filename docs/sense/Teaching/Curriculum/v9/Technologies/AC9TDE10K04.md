> analyse and make judgements on the ethical, secure and sustainable production and marketing of food and fibre enterprises

Elaborations


- _AC9TDE10K04_E1_ - analysing grain sources used by First Nations Australians, such as acacia, for their nutrient content, including energy, fat and protein and suitability as a sustainable food source in drought or famine-prone, semi-arid, and tropical regions, as compared with cereal crops such as wheat and rice

- _AC9TDE10K04_E2_ - examining emerging production technologies and methods in terms of productivity, profitability and sustainability, for example taking account of animal welfare considerations in food and fibre production enterprises, protected cropping, hydroponics or aquaculture

- _AC9TDE10K04_E3_ - investigating how digital tools could be used to enhance food production systems, for example global positioning systems (GPS) for managing animals, crop sensors, automated animal-feeding or milking systems, or drones for locating and managing weeds

- _AC9TDE10K04_E4_ - investigating the interdependence of plants and animals and comparing the environmental impacts of intensive and extensive production systems and their contribution to food and fibre production, for example the impact of pesticide use on bee populations or comparing caged and free-range chicken production

- _AC9TDE10K04_E5_ - considering the meaning of food and water security and how they may influence design decisions for creating preferred futures, for example using water-efficient irrigation, protected cropping where crops are grown under cover to increase production over a longer period or choosing drought-resistant varieties of plants and animals

- _AC9TDE10K04_E6_ - examining the marketing chain of a range of agricultural products and outlining the effect of product processing and advertising on demand and price including the impact of cash crops on communities
