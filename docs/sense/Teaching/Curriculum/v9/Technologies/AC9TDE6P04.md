> negotiate design criteria including sustainability to evaluate design ideas, processes and solutions

Elaborations


- _AC9TDE6P04_E1_ - deciding on design criteria collaboratively for a designed solution, for example including an environmental sustainability criterion such as product should be recyclable

- _AC9TDE6P04_E2_ - developing design criteria with others to evaluate the suitability of materials, tools and equipment for specific purposes, for example considering the most suitable fabric, tools and equipment needed to make beeswax wraps

- _AC9TDE6P04_E3_ - iterating and modifying design ideas based on evaluation to improve solutions, for example modifying the sensitivity of sensors in the design of an automated light

- _AC9TDE6P04_E4_ - evaluating their designed solutions including considering the benefits and costs of production processes and the environmental impact, for example for the production of an animal shelter

- _AC9TDE6P04_E5_ - reflecting on designed solutions to evaluate and assess suitability and sustainability and determine how well they meet design criteria, for example gathering relevant data to make judgements about a school or community fundraising event in relation to waste reduction, attendance and funds raised, and considering how these aspects could be handled in future events
