> explore how technologies including materials affect movement in products

Elaborations


- _AC9TDE2K02_E1_ - investigating First Nations Australiansâ€™ instructive toys and how such toys are designed and made to produce movement, for example propeller toys made from pandanus across northern Australia

- _AC9TDE2K02_E2_ - selecting materials to show how material properties are appropriate for particular designed solutions, for example materials that enable sliding, floating or flying

- _AC9TDE2K02_E3_ - exploring how to manipulate materials using a range of tools, equipment and techniques to create movement, for example when constructing a toy boat that floats or a kite that flies

- _AC9TDE2K02_E4_ - exploring a system such as a marionette or Indonesian wayang kulit shadow puppet to see that by combining materials with forces movement can be created

- _AC9TDE2K02_E5_ - testing materials to see how they affect movement and speed, for example the movement of a wheeled toy on different surfaces such as timber, carpet, rubber and plastic
