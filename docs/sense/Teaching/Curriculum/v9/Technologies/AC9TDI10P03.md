- _AC9TDI10P03_E1_ - modelling entities and processes, their attributes and the relationships between them, for example creating database tables for a movie, a user and their movie review, where a movie has a title, genre and release date, and a review has a movie, a user and their rating and comments

- _AC9TDI10P03_E2_ - using structured data to help in decision-making, for example creating a data schema for a relational database and building the database, incorporating query and reporting functionality to solve a problem of student choice

- _AC9TDI10P03_E3_ - interpreting and querying multi-table databases using SQL queries with SELECT, WHERE and simple JOIN/GROUP BY clauses and counting, for example checking that each user has only reviewed each movie once
