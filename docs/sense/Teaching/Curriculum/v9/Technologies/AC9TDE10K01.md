> analyse how people in design and technologies occupations consider ethical, security and sustainability factors to innovate and improve products, services and environments

Elaborations


- _AC9TDE10K01_E1_ - examining sustainability factors influencing the design and production of a solution developed by First Nations Australians, such as the sustainable production of culturally significant pigments, for example in many places throughout Australia white and red pigments are not freely available and must be manufactured through a complex process of calcination by firing rocks or clays in a kiln

- _AC9TDE10K01_E2_ - analysing design and technologies professions and their contributions to society, for example engineers working in disaster recovery or empowering communities to improve access to clean, safe energy

- _AC9TDE10K01_E3_ - recognising the impact of past designed solutions when creating solutions for preferred futures, for example the design of public transport systems that use renewable energy and are accessible, and the design of rural community environments to reduce fire risk

- _AC9TDE10K01_E4_ - considering the factors that influence design and manufacture, and the work of professional designers, engineers and technologists, including time, access to skills, knowledge, finance, expertise in global engineering and manufacturing, for example Australian designers and engineers working with rapid prototyping manufacturers in a country in Asia or the significance of the collaboration between Australia and Vietnam on the development of the Cao Lanh Bridge

- _AC9TDE10K01_E5_ - explaining how product life cycle thinking can influence decision-making related to design and technologies, for example rethinking products to provide for re-use, selecting a material for a product that has a lower carbon footprint

- _AC9TDE10K01_E6_ - examining mass production systems taking into account ethics and sustainability considerations, for example the mass production of food, clothing and shoes and why manufacturers produce different versions of the same product and support complete product life cycle strategies

- _AC9TDE10K01_E7_ - explaining the consequences of ethical and sustainability decisions for products, services and environments, for example the accessibility of a managed public environment, the design of roads to include aerial bridges for wildlife and signage powered with solar technologies
