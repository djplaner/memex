> implement, modify and debug programs involving control structures and functions in a general-purpose programming language

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9TDI8P09_E1_ - writing and editing programs to solve problems using branching, iteration, variables and functions in a general-purpose programming language, such as Python, JavaScript or C#
	- _AC9TDI8P09_E2_ - reading and interpreting an existing program and modifying the code to change functionality and fix errors, for example taking existing code for a weather forecasting app that includes temperatures and improving the output to include extra information such as rainfall, UV levels and air quality
	- _AC9TDI8P09_E3_ - writing a program that receives data from the environment to change the program behaviour, for example reading moisture level data from a soil sensor and switching on the watering system
	- _AC9TDI8P09_E4_ - writing a program that contains nested control structures to perform more complicated branching and decisions, for example using an IF statement inside a loop to count the warm days from an array containing temperature data only when the temperature for each day is more than 20 degrees Celsius
	- _AC9TDI8P09_E5_ - defining and using a function that produces different output based on the argument(s) it receives, for example a function that receives the name of an actor from user input, and searches a file or database to return a list of movies that actor appears in
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASTEC7804_ - Students design and trace algorithms; and implement them in a general-purpose programming language.
	- _ASTECTDI7803_ - They design and trace algorithms and implement them in a general-purpose programming language.
