> recognise different types of data and explore how the same data can be represented differently depending on the purpose

Elaborations


- _AC9TDI4K03_E1_ - describing different types of data and how they can be used, for example numbers, letters, symbols and pictures

- _AC9TDI4K03_E2_ - <p>explaining how the same data can be represented in different ways and why some representations are better than others in certain contexts, for example four vs 4 vs IV vs I I I I vs <em>quatre</em> and that numerals are better for calculation than words</p>

- _AC9TDI4K03_E3_ - explaining that the same information can be represented differently, for example the term ‘stop’ can also be represented with an octagon-shaped red sign or a hand icon

- _AC9TDI4K03_E4_ - identifying rock paintings and other cultural expressions to understand that images are used to encode and represent ethnobotanical knowledge, for example the representation of plant use in the Kimberley cave paintings and ancient engravings including important data on medicinal and food plant classification and their usable parts
