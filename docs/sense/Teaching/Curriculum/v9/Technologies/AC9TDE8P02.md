> generate, test, iterate and communicate design ideas, processes and solutions using technical terms and graphical representation techniques, including using digital tools

Elaborations


- _AC9TDE8P02_E1_ - using a variety of strategies such as brainstorming, sketching, 3D modelling and experimenting to generate innovative design ideas to present to others

- _AC9TDE8P02_E2_ - considering which ideas to further explore and investigating the benefits and drawbacks of ideas including identifying factors that may hinder or enhance project development, for example using digital polling to capture the views of different groups in the community to inform the production of a solution designed with intercultural understanding

- _AC9TDE8P02_E3_ - developing models, prototypes or samples using a range of materials, tools and equipment to test the functionality of ideas

- _AC9TDE8P02_E4_ - producing annotated concept sketches and drawings, using technical terms, scale, symbols, pictorial and aerial views to draw environments; production drawings, perspective drawings, orthogonal drawings; patterns and templates to explain product design ideas

- _AC9TDE8P02_E5_ - documenting and communicating the generation and development and selection of design ideas for an intended audience, for example developing a digital portfolio with images and text which clearly communicate each step of a design process
