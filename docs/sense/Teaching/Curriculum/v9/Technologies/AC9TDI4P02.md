> follow and describe algorithms involving sequencing, comparison operators (branching) and iteration

Elaborations


- _AC9TDI4P02_E1_ - following the steps and decisions of algorithms and knowing what step they are up to, for example following rules to form the past tense of regular verbs such as ‘create’ to ‘created’, ‘try’ to ‘tried’ and ‘cook’ to ‘cooked’ and checking off items on a list as they are completed

- _AC9TDI4P02_E2_ - describing algorithms using representations such as a list of steps or a diagram, for example drawing a diagram of a recipe involving decisions

- _AC9TDI4P02_E3_ - understanding there can be more than one sequence of steps to solve a problem, some are better than others, and the steps should be unambiguous, for example describing 2 different ways to get to the same location

- _AC9TDI4P02_E4_ - describing the decisions needed to solve a problem, including numerical and text comparisons, for example if the UV index is above 3, put on sunscreen and a hat

- _AC9TDI4P02_E5_ - describing algorithms that repeat steps a fixed number of times, for example calculating multiplication using repeated addition, where the sum changes in each iteration
