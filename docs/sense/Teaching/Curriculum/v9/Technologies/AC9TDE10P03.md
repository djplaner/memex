> select, justify, test and use suitable technologies, skills and processes, and apply safety procedures to safely make designed solutions

Elaborations


- _AC9TDE10P03_E1_ - refining technical skills and using production skills with independence to produce quality designed solutions and reducing risks in production with appropriate, safe working practices required for a specific design project, for example independently setting up a lathe and wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) to produce a part to specified dimensions

- _AC9TDE10P03_E2_ - using materials, components, tools, equipment and techniques safely and considering alternatives to maximise sustainability, for example using timber because it stores carbon and offsets the demand for alternative products

- _AC9TDE10P03_E3_ - experimenting with innovative combinations and ways of manipulating traditional and contemporary materials, components, tools, equipment and techniques, and recording findings in a collaborative space to debate the merits of each with peers

- _AC9TDE10P03_E4_ - modifying production processes to respond to opportunities, risks or unforeseen challenges, for example when producing bulk quantities of recipes in terms of workload and coordination, the impact of lower-than-average rainfalls on crop growth or using materials with unexpected faults

- _AC9TDE10P03_E5_ - experimenting with the functional and sensory properties of food to determine the most successful approach, for example preparing vegetables 3 different ways to maximise colour, flavour and nutritive value
