> evaluate existing and student solutions against the design criteria, user stories and possible future impact

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9TDI8P10_E1_ - evaluating how an existing solution ensures users can control their safety and experience online as described in the Safety by Design Vision for Young People, for example ensuring privacy settings are comprehensive, easy to use and set to maximum protection by default
	- _AC9TDI8P10_E2_ - reviewing the requirements of a user story to ensure that their solution meets the user's needs, for example making sure that recommendations offered by their music application are of a similar genre to the rest of the user's library
	- _AC9TDI8P10_E3_ - judging existing solutions on the basis of their possible impact on the economy, environment or society, for example cloud computing services decrease data loss but require vast amounts of electricity to power the servers
