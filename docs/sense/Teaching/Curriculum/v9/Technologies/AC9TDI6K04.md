> explore how data can be represented by off and on states (zeros and ones in binary)

Elaborations


- _AC9TDI6K04_E1_ - making collaboratively a long thread with beads representing binary for the letters that spell the Country/Place name in the local First Nations language and English, and could be displayed as a ‘binary banner’ as an Acknowledgement of Country that we are on the Traditional Lands of the <insert name> Peoples

- _AC9TDI6K04_E2_ - demonstrating that an on/off state in a circuit can represent the digits one and zero, and this is how digital systems represent data

- _AC9TDI6K04_E3_ - recognising how the answer to a yes/no question can be represented using on/off states, for example switching a light on or off in a circuit or a long or short dash (beep) in Morse code
