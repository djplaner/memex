> design algorithms involving nested control structures and represent them using flowcharts and pseudocode

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9TDI8P05_E1_ - designing an algorithm or modifying an existing algorithm to fix an error or change functionality, for example calculating the coins and notes needed for an amount of money and changing the algorithm to handle new denominations
	- _AC9TDI8P05_E2_ - describing algorithms precisely in pseudocode (structured English) or with flowcharts for each part of the problem, for example using separate flowcharts to describe the purchase of an item and the giving of change during the purchase
	- _AC9TDI8P05_E3_ - describing algorithms with nested control structures, including a nested if, for example IF it is raining THEN [IF parents are home THEN drive to school]; or an IF inside a loop, for example REPEAT [select the largest coin smaller than the remaining total, and subtract it] UNTIL the remainder is zero
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASTEC7804_ - Students design and trace algorithms; and implement them in a general-purpose programming language.
	- _ASTECTDI7803_ - They design and trace algorithms and implement them in a general-purpose programming language.
