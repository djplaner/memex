> generate, communicate and evaluate design ideas, and use materials, equipment and steps to safely make a solution for a purpose

Elaborations


- _AC9TDEFP01_E1_ - identifying a purpose for designing and making a solution, for example the sand keeps blowing out of the sandpit, the birds keep flying into the waste bin and taking food scraps or people with disability need to know where they can park at school

- _AC9TDEFP01_E2_ - exploring ideas by drawing or modelling and choosing the most suitable idea, for example drawing or modelling designs for bee hotels to attract native bees to the school garden and choosing one to make, and changing perspectives from front view to plan view

- _AC9TDEFP01_E3_ - evaluating what they have made using personal preferences, for example using a smiley face Likert scale

- _AC9TDEFP01_E4_ - exploring how available materials can be used or re-used in construction play, for example using blocks and rain gutters or cardboard to make a ramp to roll a ball or toy car down

- _AC9TDEFP01_E5_ - practising a range of technical skills safely using equipment, for example joining techniques when making a product from materials, such as a greenhouse to keep a seedling warm or a trellis for holding up tomato plants

- _AC9TDEFP01_E6_ - assembling components of systems and checking they function as planned, for example making and testing a bowling, stacking or obstacle game with discarded food containers or packaging
