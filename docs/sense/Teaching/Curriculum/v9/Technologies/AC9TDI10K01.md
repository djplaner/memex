> investigate how hardware and software manage, control and secure access to data in networked digital systems

Elaborations


- _AC9TDI10K01_E1_ - explaining how the operating system hides the complexity of different hardware from applications, for example applications can treat input from a mouse and touch screen in the same way

- _AC9TDI10K01_E2_ - exploring how public key cryptography, for example TLS, and hashing, such as SHA-1, secure the storage and transmission of data

- _AC9TDI10K01_E3_ - configuring a simple network using real or simulated hardware and observing packets moving around the network, for example monitoring packets on simulated switches and networked devices

- _AC9TDI10K01_E4_ - explaining how domain names and IP addresses allow data to be transmitted to specific networked devices, for example DNS and routing tables

- _AC9TDI10K01_E5_ - describing elements of access control and explaining why they are necessary, for example authentication and permissions for restricting access to install software to administrators
