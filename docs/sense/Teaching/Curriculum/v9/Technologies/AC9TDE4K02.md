> describe how forces and the properties of materials affect function in a product or system

Elaborations


- _AC9TDE4K02_E1_ - researching how First Nations Australians consider buoyant forces as they select materials for watercraft, for example making bark or dugout canoes

- _AC9TDE4K02_E2_ - looking at models to identify how materials are used and movement is created, for example in the design of a toy with wheels or moving parts

- _AC9TDE4K02_E3_ - exploring through play how movement can be started by combining materials and using forces, for example releasing a wound rubber band to propel a model boat, how different materials may impact a marble roll speed, or how various surfaces from carpet to grass to concrete might affect a robotâ€™s movement

- _AC9TDE4K02_E4_ - <p>deconstructing a product or system to identify how motion and forces affect performance, for example in a puppet such as a Japanese <em>bunraku puppet</em> or a model windmill with moving sails</p>

- _AC9TDE4K02_E5_ - identifying engineered systems and experimenting with available local materials, tools and equipment to solve problems, for example designing a container or parachute that will keep an egg intact when dropped from a height; a pop-up card; a tower; or a vehicle
