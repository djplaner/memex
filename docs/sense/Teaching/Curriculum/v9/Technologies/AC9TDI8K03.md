> investigate how digital systems represent text, image and audio data using integers

Elaborations


- _AC9TDI8K03_E1_ - explaining how digital systems represent text as a sequence of individual characters numbered using the Unicode character set, for example upper-case and lower-case letters, punctuation andâ€¯emoji

- _AC9TDI8K03_E2_ - explaining how digital systems represent audio using whole numbers for the amplitude of the soundwave at a given sampling rate, for example -32,768 to 32,767 for 16-bit audio at 44,100 Hz

- _AC9TDI8K03_E3_ - explaining how digital systems represent bitmap images (for example PNG and JPEG) as the colour of each pixel in separate red, green and blue (RGB) channels ranging from 0 to 255, and represent Scalable Vector graphics (SVG) using the geometry of lines and shapes

- _AC9TDI8K03_E4_ - investigating how a digital system converts audio data to integers as it records, stores and outputs sound, for example using the Welcome to Country app to understand the local history and Traditional Owners of the lands which students learn on to inform the programming of an Acknowledgement of Country in a local First Nations Australian language
