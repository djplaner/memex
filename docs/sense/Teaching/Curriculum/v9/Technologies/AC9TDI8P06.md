> trace algorithms to predict output for a given input and to identify errors

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9TDI8P06_E1_ - following an algorithm precisely to confirm it produces the expected output for the given input, for example desk check with a table of input, variables and output
	- _AC9TDI8P06_E2_ - specifying test cases and comparing the expected and actual output to determine the correctness of an algorithm, for example a test case of the change-calculating algorithm could have input $1.45 and expected output 1 x $1, 2 x 20c and 1 x 5c coins
	- _AC9TDI8P06_E3_ - following instructions for making woven baskets or nets by hand, as done by First Nations Australians, and making predictions of how the instructions would need to be modified to enable the item to be produced through automated manufacturing processes
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASTEC7804_ - Students design and trace algorithms; and implement them in a general-purpose programming language.
	- _ASTECTDI7803_ - They design and trace algorithms and implement them in a general-purpose programming language.
