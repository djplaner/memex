> design algorithms involving logical operators and represent them as flowcharts and pseudocode

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9TDI10P05_E1_ - designing an algorithm or modifying an existing algorithm to fix, extend or improve it, for example fixing a bug in an algorithm to detect if 2 shapes intersect when the shapes just touch or extending the algorithm to support a new shape
	- _AC9TDI10P05_E2_ - describing algorithms using flowcharts or other appropriate diagram types, for example a decision tree for classifying an animal based on physical characteristics
	- _AC9TDI10P05_E3_ - describing algorithms precisely and succinctly using pseudocode, for example short, unambiguous statements such as IF length of word is greater than 4 AND first letter is a vowel
	- _AC9TDI10P05_E4_ - using Boolean operations (that is, AND, OR and NOT) to express complex conditions in control structures, for example IF [the temperature is above 30 degrees AND people are inside the building] THEN open the windows
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASTECTDI91003_ - They design and validate algorithms and implement them, including in an object-oriented programming language.
