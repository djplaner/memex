Elaborations


- _AC9TDI10K02_E1_ - representing documents by separating the content (the text in the document), the structure (the document structure such as headings and paragraphs) and presentation (how the document is laid out and styled)

- _AC9TDI10K02_E2_ - writing web pages using HyperText Markup Language (HTML) for the content and structure and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for styling the page and explaining how HTML tags separate content from structure

- _AC9TDI10K02_E3_ - explaining how representing content, structure and presentation separately allows each of them to be designed, edited, manipulated and stored independently of the others and why this isâ€¯important
