- _AC9TDI4K01_E2_ - adding peripherals to a digital system to expand its functionality, for example connecting a headset to a digital system to participate in an online lesson more effectively

- _AC9TDI4K01_E3_ - exploring how they can use digital systems differently depending on the task, recognising that many digital systems can perform multiple tasks, for example a student can use a tablet to take photos, record audio and find information to create a presentation
