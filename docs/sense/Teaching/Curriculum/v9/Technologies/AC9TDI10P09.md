> implement, modify and debug modular programs, applying selected algorithms and data structures, including in an object-oriented programming language

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9TDI10P09_E1_ - writing and editing programs to solve problems using algorithms and data structures in general-purpose and object-oriented programming languages, such as Python, JavaScript or C#
	- _AC9TDI10P09_E2_ - debugging a program by locating an error, modifying the program, and verifying that the changes made are correct, for example identifying the line in the code where an error occurs by reading an error message, printing out the variables to deduce what is causing the problem, and testing any fixes by entering data that could create similar errors
	- _AC9TDI10P09_E3_ - reading and interpreting programs split across files, functions or classes, and modifying them to add functionality, for example using the codebase of an existing adventure game and building new characters, levels or abilities
	- _AC9TDI10P09_E4_ - writing programs that receive structured data from the user that determines the program's behaviour, for example processing a file that contains timestamped data captured by an altitude sensor from a plastic bottle rocket to graph its flight path
	- _AC9TDI10P09_E5_ - applying simple data structures and algorithms appropriately in their programs, for example using an array to store temperature data for a month, a dictionary to store character information in a role-playing game (RPG), and the binary search function from a library to find a value in a sorted array
	- _AC9TDI10P09_E6_ - defining their own classes to model and define the actions that can be performed on data in their programs, for example defining a class for a book that stores information such as the author, title and publisher, and methods that are used to track the book's status in a library management system or store inventory
	- _AC9TDI10P09_E7_ - selecting different types of data structures such as array, record and object to model structured data
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASTECTDI91003_ - They design and validate algorithms and implement them, including in an object-oriented programming language.
