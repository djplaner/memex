> explain how people in design and technologies occupations consider competing factors including sustainability in the design of products, services and environments

Elaborations


- _AC9TDE6K01_E1_ - investigating how First Nations Australians have long considered competing factors especially those related to sustainability in the design of fish harvesting technologies, for example fish traps and fish poisons that allow for selective harvesting and release of bycatch, as compared with high-yield, non-selective harvesting practices such as trawling

- _AC9TDE6K01_E2_ - describing the impact and sustainability implications of designed products, services or environments on local, regional and global communities, for example the emergence of small businesses that are recycling materials, such as plastic tags and bottle tops into prosthetics

- _AC9TDE6K01_E3_ - explaining the importance of aesthetics, function and sustainability in product design, for example a textile product that gives ultraviolet protection and is appealing; an odour-fighting wool fabric that minimises washing; a motor that moves a vehicle and uses a sustainable power source; a modification to a home to reduce environmental impact; restoring a natural environment and enabling low-impact access for the public such as boardwalks in fragile wet heath or swamp ecosystems

- _AC9TDE6K01_E4_ - identifying the components of a service that contribute to its success and assessing potential risk or failure, for example a community service announcement to communicate a message in the school or to a wide audience; a service that manages an aspect of the environment such as Clean Up Australia Day in different communities

- _AC9TDE6K01_E5_ - considering how engineers resolve competing factors to produce innovative solutions, for example experimenting with novel ideas such as biomimicry to engineer a solution such as a soft robotic device

- _AC9TDE6K01_E6_ - considering how Safety by Design principles have been used in the design of products, services or environments, for example considering how prevention, protection and proactive change can be used to improve safety of designed solutions
