> design algorithms involving multiple alternatives (branching) and iteration

Elaborations


- _AC9TDI6P02_E1_ - designing an algorithm or understanding and modifying an existing algorithm to fix an error or change functionality, for example exploring issues in drought-prone areas to decide when to water a garden, taking into account humidity as well as soil moisture level

- _AC9TDI6P02_E2_ - creating the steps, decisions and loops in algorithms and knowing what step they are up to, for example repeating the steps to add 2 digits for each column in multi-digit addition, knowing which column they are adding and when to stop

- _AC9TDI6P02_E3_ - constructing more than one sequence of steps that solve the same problem and explaining why one is better than the other, for example specifying the exact route through a maze versus using the right-hand rule that works for all mazes

- _AC9TDI6P02_E4_ - modelling a decision that has more than 2 options to select the next step, for example selecting transport IF distance is less than 2 km THEN walk, ELSE IF the distance is less than 5 km THEN ride a bike, ELSE catch the bus

- _AC9TDI6P02_E5_ - planning algorithms that repeat until a condition is met, for example keep mixing UNTIL the ingredients are combined or subtracting a number UNTIL the result reaches zero

- _AC9TDI6P02_E6_ - designing an algorithm including branching and iteration which responds to data, for example how First Nations Australian rangers use structured procedures to respond to live tracking data that indicates feral buffalo are approaching an environmentally or culturally significant site
