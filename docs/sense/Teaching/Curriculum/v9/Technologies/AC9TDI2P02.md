> follow and describe algorithms involving a sequence of steps, branching (decisions) and iteration (repetition)

Elaborations


- _AC9TDI2P02_E1_ - following a short, ordered sequence of steps and making decisions to solve a simple problem, for example follow a recipe or directions to reach a location

- _AC9TDI2P02_E2_ - describing the steps and decisions (in the correct order) needed to solve a simple problem, for example writing, saying, drawing or photographing the steps needed to make a sandwich

- _AC9TDI2P02_E3_ - rearranging into the correct order a series of mixed-up pictures that describe a story, for example stories authored and published by First Nations Australians

- _AC9TDI2P02_E4_ - identifying the steps needed to solve a problem, and understanding when their order is important, for example socks must be put on before shoes but a jumper can be put on before or after shoes

- _AC9TDI2P02_E5_ - identifying the decisions needed to solve a problem and the next steps to follow in each case, for example if it is raining, take a raincoat, otherwise take a hat

- _AC9TDI2P02_E6_ - following algorithms that repeat a single step a fixed number of times, for example practise spelling a word 5 times or throw and catch a ball with a partner 10 times
