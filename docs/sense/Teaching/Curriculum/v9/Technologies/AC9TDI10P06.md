> validate algorithms and programs by comparing their output against a range of test cases

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9TDI10P06_E1_ - tracing and debugging an algorithm by identifying when its state is unexpected, why this has occurred, and the changes needed to correct it, for example identifying that a loop has finished one iteration too early
	- _AC9TDI10P06_E2_ - determining boundary test cases and testing that they are handled correctly by a program, for example checking that an intersection is detected when 2 shapes are perfectly aligned
	- _AC9TDI10P06_E3_ - generating invalid input and user errors and testing that they are handled appropriately by a program, for example checking that a program does not crash when text is entered instead of a number
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASTECTDI91003_ - They design and validate algorithms and implement them, including in an object-oriented programming language.
