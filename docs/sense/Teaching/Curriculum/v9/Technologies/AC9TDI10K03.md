> investigate simple data compression techniques

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9TDI10K03_E1_ - using an algorithm to identify patterns in data and represent them in a compressed way, for example repeated pixels in an image with run-length encoding
	- _AC9TDI10K03_E2_ - exploring the difference between lossy and lossless compression and the consequences of each, for example exploring codecs for audiovisual compression such as MP3, MP4 and WAV formats, considering energy requirements of file sizes
	- _AC9TDI10K03_E3_ - examining an image and discussing whether the image quality would be compromised if all the blue pixels of the sky in one row were to be replaced by one token and the number of pixels itâ€¯represents
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASTECTDI91002_ - Students acquire, interpret and model complex data with databases and represent documents as content, structure and presentation.
