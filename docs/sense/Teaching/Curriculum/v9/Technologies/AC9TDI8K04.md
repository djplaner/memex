> explain how and why digital systems represent integers in binary

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9TDI8K04_E1_ - explaining how whole numbers can be represented in binary, for example counting in binary from 0â€¯to 31, and recognising that one byte = 8 bits, which can represent from 0 to 255
	- _AC9TDI8K04_E2_ - explaining how digital systems represent data in binary, for example by converting a character to its Unicode value, then converting that value into binary
	- _AC9TDI8K04_E3_ - explaining how circuits can perform binary operations represented as on/off states, for example showing how circuits with 2 switches can represent AND or OR gates
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASTEC7803_ - They acquire, interpret and model with spreadsheets and represent data with integers and binary.
	- _ASTECTDI7802_ - Students acquire, interpret and model data with spreadsheets and represent data with integers and binary.
