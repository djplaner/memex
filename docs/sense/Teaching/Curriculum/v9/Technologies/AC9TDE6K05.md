> explain how characteristics and properties of materials, systems, components, tools and equipment affect their use when producing designed solutions

Elaborations


- _AC9TDE6K05_E1_ - investigating how First Nations Australians have long used material science knowledge to identify materials and preparation techniques to meet performance needs, for example twining techniques of string and rope fibres to ensure suitability for use in wet, dry, freshwater and saltwater applications

- _AC9TDE6K05_E2_ - identifying and describing the properties of materials for the design and construction of a household product or system to improve household sustainability, for example a product for storing harvested water or reducing energy consumption

- _AC9TDE6K05_E3_ - describing the materials and systems used in public places and facilities that benefit the way people live, for example a community exercise environment, arts facility, water treatment plant or garbage collection service

- _AC9TDE6K05_E4_ - comparing and describing the tools, equipment and techniques used to manufacture products in factories with those used by local and regional enterprises including cost and impacts, for example clothing made in factories compared with local handmade garments

- _AC9TDE6K05_E5_ - comparing the design and production of products, services or environments in Australia and a country in Asia, for example comparing the diversity, availability and properties of preferred materials and the design of public shelters and housing in Indonesia and Australia

- _AC9TDE6K05_E6_ - investigating the properties of fibres and how these are used to create products, for example designing an experiment to test which fabrics are warmest and explaining how those properties influence what they are used for
