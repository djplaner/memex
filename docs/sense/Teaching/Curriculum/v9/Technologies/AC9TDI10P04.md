> define and decompose real-world problems with design criteria and by interviewing stakeholders to create user stories

??? note "Elaborations"

	- _AC9TDI10P04_E1_ - creating user stories by interviewing a stakeholder to complete a template such as "As a <type of user>, I want <some goal> so that <some reason>", for example interviewing an amateur athlete to complete the template, such as "As an athlete, I want to ensure my energy intake is high enough to complete a half marathon."
	- _AC9TDI10P04_E2_ - defining the problem with precision and some awareness of scope, for example "How do we encourage people to balance their energy intake and expenditure?" and "Can this be solved in a specified timeframe?"
	- _AC9TDI10P04_E3_ - asking questions that help them define the problem more precisely, for example "How do we measure energy intake?" or "How much energy does each exercise expend?"
	- _AC9TDI10P04_E4_ - recognising the importance of diverse perspectives when defining the problem and devising survey or interview questions to elicit stakeholder needs, for example “What types of exercise count?” and allowing open-ended responses to the exercise they do
	- _AC9TDI10P04_E5_ - exploring how First Nations Australian cultural stories and languages are being preserved with digital systems, for example how communities could record, animate and maintain their connections with culture and language in a contemporary format that resonates with young people to help ensure that vital practices continue
??? note "Achievement Standard Components"

	- _ASTECTDI91001_ - By the end of Year 10 students develop and modify innovative digital solutions, decompose real-world problems, and critically evaluate alternative solutions against stakeholder elicited user stories.
