> select, justify and use suitable materials, components, tools, equipment, skills and processes to safely make designed solutions

Elaborations


- _AC9TDE8P03_E1_ - developing innovative ways of manipulating technologies by comparing and choosing the most appropriate options to design a solution using traditional or contemporary materials, components, tools, equipment and techniques and considering alternatives including emerging technologies that could be substituted to reduce waste or time

- _AC9TDE8P03_E2_ - practising techniques to improve expertise, for example handling animals, cutting and joining materials such as metal, textiles, timber

- _AC9TDE8P03_E3_ - developing technical production skills (techniques) and safe independent inclusive working practices to produce quality solutions designed for sustainability

- _AC9TDE8P03_E4_ - identifying and managing risks in the development of various projects, for example working safely, responsibly, cooperatively and ethically on design projects; assessing and responding to uncertainty and risk in relation to long-term health and environmental impacts, for example ensuring appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) is worn or that ventilation is appropriate where solvents, glues or 3D printers are used

- _AC9TDE8P03_E5_ - considering how to improve technical expertise required to use tools or equipment needed to design a solution, for example using an online tutorial to learn to use software for design orâ€¯production
