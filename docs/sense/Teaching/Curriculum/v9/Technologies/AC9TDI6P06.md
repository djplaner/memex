> evaluate existing and student solutions against the design criteria and user stories and their broader community impact

Elaborations


- _AC9TDI6P06_E1_ - evaluating the effectiveness of their own solutions to address the identified problem from the user stories, for example checking if the information created for the local interactive history walk is relevant and meets the council's needs

- _AC9TDI6P06_E2_ - evaluating how an existing solution provides users with safety tools and features such as those described in the Safety by Design Vision for Young People, for example having a clearly visible button to easily report and block inappropriate behaviour in an app or on a website

- _AC9TDI6P06_E3_ - reflecting on the many systems that are used in the wider community to address a range of problems, for example timetables to manage transport and other services through to details such as storing licence information so that police can enforce road rules
