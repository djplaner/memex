    In particular, it's an example of leveraging the reprogrammability of digital technologies to orchestrate (gather, weave and augment) a range of technologies (the Australian Curriculum, RDF, Python, Foam etc) for a very specific purpose. In this case specific to an individual teacher. Rather than make do with the generic Australian Curriculum site the same data as been woven into something more useful (for me).

??? info "Year level description"

	In Year 7, learning in Mathematics builds on each student’s prior learning and experiences. Students engage in a range of approaches to learning and doing mathematics that develop their understanding of and fluency with concepts, procedures and processes by making connections, reasoning, problem-solving and practice. Proficiency in mathematics enables students to respond to familiar and unfamiliar situations by employing mathematical strategies to make informed decisions and solve problems efficiently.
	
	
	Students further develop proficiency and positive dispositions towards mathematics and its use as they:
	
	
	* extend their understanding of the integer and rational number systems, strengthen their fluency with mental calculation, written algorithms and digital tools; and routinely consider the reasonableness of results in context
	* use exponents and exponent notation to consolidate and formalise their understanding of representations of natural numbers, and use these to make conjectures involving natural numbers by experiment with the assistance of digital tools
	* recognise the use of algebraic expressions and formulas using conventions, notations, symbols and pronumerals. They interpret algebraic expressions and formulas, use substitution to evaluate and determine unknown terms where other values are given, and solve simple equations using a variety of methods
	* use mathematical modelling to solve practical problems involving rational numbers, ratios and percentages, formulating and making choices about representations, calculation strategies and communicating solutions within the context
	* use variables, constants, relations and functions to express relationships in real life data and interpret key features of their representation in rules, tables and graphs
	* extend their knowledge of angles to establish further relationships and apply these when solving measurement and spatial problems
	* create and use algorithms to classify shapes in the plane and use tools to construct shapes, including two-dimensional representations of prisms and other objects
	* use coordinates in the Cartesian plane to describe transformations
	* apply the statistical investigation process to obtain numerical data related to questions of interest, choose displays for the distributions of data and interpret summary statistics for determining the centre and spread of the data in context

#### Year 10

 

??? info "Year level description"

	In Year 10, learning in Mathematics builds on each student’s prior learning and experiences. Students engage in a range of approaches to learning and doing mathematics that develop their understanding of and fluency with concepts, procedures and processes by making connections, reasoning, problem-solving and practice. Proficiency in mathematics enables students to respond to familiar and unfamiliar situations by employing mathematical strategies to make informed decisions and solve problems efficiently.
	
	
	Students further develop proficiency and positive dispositions towards mathematics and its use as they:
	
	
	* investigate the accuracy of decimal approximations to irrational real numbers; consider the accuracy of computation with real numbers in context and the use of logarithmic scales to deal with phenomena involving small and large quantities and change
	* apply numerical, graphical and algebraic approaches to analyse the behaviour of pairs of linear equations and linear inequalities in 2 variables
	* generalise and extend their repertoire of algebraic techniques involving quadratic and exponential algebraic expressions
	* use mathematical modelling to solve problems in applied situations exhibiting growth or decay using linear, quadratic and exponential functions; and solve related equations, numerically, graphically and algebraically, with the use of digital tools as applicable
	* solve measurement problems involving the surface area and volume of common objects, composite objects and irregular objects; use Pythagoras’ theorem and trigonometry of right-angled triangles to solve spatial problems in two- and three-dimensions, and manipulate images of their representations using digital tools
	* apply geometric theorems to deduce results and solve problems involving plane shapes, and interpret networks and network diagrams in authentic contexts
	* investigate conditional probability and its relation to dependent and independent events, including sampling with and without replacement; devise and use simulations to test intuitions involving chance events that may or may not be independent
	* compare different ways of representing the distribution of continuous data and interpret key features of the distribution; explore association between pairs of variables, decide the form of representation, interpret the data with respect to the context and discuss possible conclusions; use scatterplots to informally discuss and consider association between 2 numerical variables and informally consider lines of good fit by eye, interpolation, extrapolation and limitations.

## Technologies

### Digital Technologies

#### Years 7 and 8

 

??? info "Year level description"

	By the end of Year 8 students should have had the opportunity to apply computational thinking by defining and decomposing real-world problems, creating user experiences, designing and modifying algorithms, and implementing them in a general-purpose programming language. This involves students practising problem decomposition, using approaches such as divide and conquer to more clearly understand a problem by describing its component parts. Students represent and communicate their algorithmic solutions using flowcharts and pseudocode. Students check their solutions meet the specifications by testing and debugging their algorithms before and during implementation. They develop a deeper understanding of abstraction by explaining how and why digital systems represent data as whole numbers, which are then represented in binary.
	
	Students build on their skills from Mathematics (*Statistics*) in acquiring and interpreting data. In Digital Technologies, students continue to advance these skills and are also given opportunities to validate the data they acquire to ensure it is accurate and consistent. They collect and transform many types of data from a wide range of sources. Students model structured data in meaningful ways using spreadsheets and single-table databases, and analyse and visualise the data to extract meaning from it.
	
	They apply design thinking by using divergent techniques, such as mind mapping, role-play and using graphic organisers, to generate design ideas for user experiences and solution designs. Students review these ideas against design criteria and created user stories throughout their implementation as general-purpose programming by assessing them against current and future needs. They extend the use of these design criteria and user stories to evaluate the future impact of existing solutions.
	
	Students apply systems thinking by exploring the connections between hardware capabilities and tasks users want to perform. They investigate how data is transmitted via wired and wireless networks and explain the need for encryption to protect and secure data. Students use an increasing range of the features of digital tools to improve their efficiency and the consistency of the content they create, locate and communicate. They plan and manage projects individually and collaboratively, improving their control over the quality of their content. Students investigate personal security controls, including multi-factor authentication, to protect their data if passwords are compromised, and they understand the impact of phishing and other cyber security threats on people and data.
	
	In Digital Technologies, students should have frequent opportunities for authentic learning by making key connections with other learning areas.
