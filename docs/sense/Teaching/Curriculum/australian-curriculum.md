        - Related content

- General capabilities;
- Cross-curriculum priorities.

## Version 9 changes

### Mathematics

- [[v9-oz-mathematics-learning-area]]

### Digital literacy

- [[v9-oz-digital-technologies]]

[Digital literacy in v9](https://v9.australiancurriculum.edu.au/resources/stories/digital-literacy-in-the-new-australian-curriculum)

ICT changed to digital literacy because

- fundamental aspect of literacy, extension of reading, writing, speaking
- "students need to develop knowledge, values, communication and critical thinking relevant for the digital age"
- ICT focused on how to use digital tools - digital literacy extends to why and when
- **BUT** still focuses on "use" - without really defining what that is, or what "digital tools" are
