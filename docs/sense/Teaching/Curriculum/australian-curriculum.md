# Australian Curriculum

See also: [[teaching]]

[ACARA's curriculum page](https://acara.edu.au/curriculum). Currently moving from v8.4 to [v9 of the Australian Curriculum](https://v9.australiancurriculum.edu.au/)

Three dimensions

- Learning areas;
- General capabilities;
- Cross-curriculum priorities.

## Version 9 changes

### Mathematics

[Revisions](https://v9.australiancurriculum.edu.au/resources/stories/revisions-to-the-australian-curriculum-mathematics)

- Interest in PISA performance a consideration - a reason for interest
- received greatest level of feedback
- STrong focus on "students developing mastery in mathematics by becoming proficient with the essential mathematical facts, concepts, procedures and processes"
- Since that mastery supports retention and transfer

Key changes 
- 6 strands: Number, Algebra, Measurement, Space, Statistics and Probability
- More explicit acheivement standards
- Increased importance on students learning how to apply mathematics to real world contexts: mathematical thinking, reasoning and problem solving process skills - opportunities to learn & engage in mathematical modelling, computational thinking, statistical investigation, probability experiments and simulations
- Increased links with numeracy general capability leading to new content: error & approximation, 3D coordinate systems, logarithmic scales, solving exponential functions and interpreting networks
- REduced content

### Digital literacy

[Digital literacy in v9](https://v9.australiancurriculum.edu.au/resources/stories/digital-literacy-in-the-new-australian-curriculum)

ICT changed to digital literacy because

- fundamental aspect of literacy, extension of reading, writing, speaking
- "students need to develop knowledge, values, communication and critical thinking relevant for the digital age"
- ICT focused on how to use digital tools - digital literacy extends to why and when
- **BUT** still focuses on "use" - without really defining what that is, or what "digital tools" are
