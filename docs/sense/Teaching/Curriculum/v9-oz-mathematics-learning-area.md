## Strands

| Strand | Description |
| --- | --- |
| number-v9 | develops ways of working with mental constructs that deal with correspondence, magnitude and order, for which operations and their properties can be defined. Numbers have wide ranging application and specific uses in counting, measuring and other means of quantifying situations and objects. Number systems are constructed to deal with different contexts and problems involving finite and infinite, discrete and continuous sets. Developing number sense and the ability to work effectively with numbers is critical to being an active and productive citizen who is successful at work and in future learning, who is financially literate, and who engages with the world and other individuals.  |
| [[algebra-v9]] | develops ways of using symbols and symbolic representations to think and reason about relationships in both mathematical and real-world contexts. It provides a means for manipulating mathematical objects, recognising patterns and structures, making connections, understanding properties of operations and the concept of equivalence, abstracting information, working with variables, solving equations and generalising number and operation facts and relationships. Algebra connects symbolic, graphic and numeric representations. It deals with situations of generality, communicating abstract ideas applied in areas such as science, health, finance, sports, engineering, and building and construction.  |
| measurement-v9 | develops ways of quantifying aspects of the human and physical world. Measures and units are defined and selected to be relevant and appropriate to the context. Measurement is used to answer questions, show results, demonstrate value, justify allocation of resources, evaluate performance, identify opportunities for improvement and manage results. Measurement underpins understanding, comparison and decision-making in many personal, societal, environmental, agricultural, industrial, health and economic contexts.  |
| space-v9 | develops ways of visualising, representing and working with the location, direction, shape, placement, proximity and transformation of objects at macro, local and micro scales in natural and constructed worlds. It underpins the capacity to make pictures, diagrams, maps, projections, networks, models and graphics that enable the manipulation and analysis of shapes and objects through actions and the senses. This includes notions such as surface, region, boundary, curve, object, dimension, connectedness, symmetry, direction, congruence and similarity. These notions apply to art, design, architecture, planning, transportation, construction and manufacturing, physics, engineering, chemistry, biology and medicine. |
| statistics-v9 | develops ways of collecting understanding and describing data and its distribution. Statistics provide a story, or means to support or question an argument, and enables exploratory data analysis that underpins decision-making and informed judgement. Statistical literacy requires an understanding of statistical information and processes, including an awareness of data and the ability to estimate, interpret, evaluate and communicate with respect to variation in the real world. Statistical literacy provides a basis for critical scrutiny of an argument, the accuracy of representations, and the validity and reliability of inferences and claims. The effective use of data requires acknowledging and expecting variation in the collection, analysis and interpretation of categorical and numerical variables. Statistics is used in business, government, research, sport, healthcare and media for critical and informed evaluation of issues, arguments and decision-making. |
| probability-v9 |  strand develops ways of dealing with uncertainty and expectation, making predictions, and characterising the chance of events, or how likely events are to occur from both empirical and theoretical bases. It provides a means of considering, analysing and utilising the chance of events, and recognising random phenomena for which it is impossible to exactly determine the next observed outcome before it occurs. In contexts where chance plays a role, probability provides experimental and theoretical ways to quantify how likely it is that a particular outcome will occur or a proposition is the case. This enables students to understand contexts involving chance and to build mathematical models surrounding risk and decision-making in a range of areas of human endeavour. These include finance, science, business management, epidemiology, games of chance, computer science and artificial intelligence. |

### Revisions - 8.4 to 9

[Revisions](https://v9.australiancurriculum.edu.au/resources/stories/revisions-to-the-australian-curriculum-mathematics)

- Interest in PISA performance a consideration - a reason for interest
- received greatest level of feedback
- STrong focus on "students developing mastery in mathematics by becoming proficient with the essential mathematical facts, concepts, procedures and processes"
- Since that mastery supports retention and transfer

Key changes 
- 6 strands: Number, Algebra, Measurement, Space, Statistics and Probability
- More explicit acheivement standards
- Increased importance on students learning how to apply mathematics to real world contexts: mathematical thinking, reasoning and problem solving process skills - opportunities to learn & engage in mathematical modelling, computational thinking, statistical investigation, probability experiments and simulations
- Increased links with numeracy general capability leading to new content: error & approximation, 3D coordinate systems, logarithmic scales, solving exponential functions and interpreting networks
- REduced content
