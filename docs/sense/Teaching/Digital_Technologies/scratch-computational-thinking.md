See: [Harvard "Computational Thinking With Scratch"](https://creativecomputing.gse.harvard.edu/ct/defining.html)

Identifies [concepts](#concepts), [practices](#practices), and [perspectives](#perspectives) for computational thinking with Scratch. Which in turn are used to inform the design of approaches for 

- Assessing the development of CT

    - Artifact-based interviews

        Using an interview protocol to engage learners in conversations about their computational practices and products. A rubric is available for assessing the evolving fluency of computational practices.
    - Design scenarios

        Learners encounter a series of projects and engage in four different ways/perspectives: critiquing, extending, debugging, and remixing. [Sample projects developed](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/573426/) where students are asked: 1) what does it do, 2) how could it be extended, 3) fix a bug, and 4) remix it.
    - Learner documentation

        Learners develop reflective traces of their learning to accompany their Scratch creations.

- Supporting the development of CT with Scratch

    - [Creative computing curriculum guide](http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/guide/)

        Collecting together ideas, strategies and activities for an introductory experience using Scratch.

    - [Select-reflective instrument](https://creativecomputing.gse.harvard.edu/ct/files/Teacher_Reflection_Tool.pdf)

        Encourages educators to evaluate/reflect on their activity designs by pondering how well they support the [computational practices](#practices)


## Concepts

Common in many programming languages, but especially in Scratch.

| Concept | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| sequence | identifying a series of steps for a task | 
| loops | running the same sequence multiple times | 
| parallelism | making things happen at the same time | 
| events | one thing causing another thing to happen | 
| conditionals | making decisions based on conditions | 
| operators | support for mathematical and logical expressions | 
| data | storing, retrieving, and updating values | 

## Practices

Concepts alone are not enough, what are the practices students engage in.

| Practice | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| experimenting and iterating | developing a little bit, then trying it out, then developing more |
| testing and debugging | making sure things work â€” and finding and solving problems when they arise |
| reusing and remixing | making something by building on existing projects or ideas |
| abstracting and modularizing | exploring connections between the whole and the parts |

## Perspectives

The shifts in perspectives young people report as they work with Scratch.

| Perspective | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| expressing | realizing that computation is a medium of creation, "I can create." |
| connecting | recognizing the power of creating with and for others, "I can do different things when I have access to others." |
| questioning | feeling empowered to ask questions about the world, "I can (use computation to) ask questions to make sense of (computational things in) the world." |
