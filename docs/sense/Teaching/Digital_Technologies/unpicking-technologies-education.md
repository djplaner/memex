### Coding contexts

AC link _create a designed solution_

Solution types

- Code solutions

    - Coding as instructional sequences to create solutions to problems
    - Programming languages treated as other ICTs (**big mistake - reprogramability is key **)
        - Makes the  point that coding is fundamental and required for all automation and information based solutions
    - being creative, solving problems, and develop innovative ideas is key
    - Year 7 focus coding to include iterations and branching
        - Block languages: Daisy, Blockley, Scratch, Foos, or Mindstorms, https://groklearning.com appears to have integrated tutorials
        - Visualisations - flowcharts
    - project-based learning is useful - scaffold student progression - development of thinking skills

- Application solutions

    - software application - main type of coding solution
    - again emphasis on solving **real-world problems**
    - https://code.org - non-profit (US) for teaching computer science
      - includes Javascript applab - blockly/online environment 
      - [educator overview](https://code.org/teach) - detailed curricula

- website solutions

    - Basic overview pointing to [codetribe - 5 minute website tutorial](https://me.codetribe.com/rocket/C1/P0/T0)

- game solutions

    - Incorporating games can be challenging

        - Many types of games, students may only be interested in some 
        - Students can become focused on mastering gameplay, rather than coding/solutions
          - The need to create "solutions to a wider problem" also mentioned
        - Complexity of game development and students attempting to do more than they are ready for 
            - Solution being to scaffold engagement - modify, rather than create etc.
            - Points to [code.og Flappy](https://studio.code.org/flappy/) as an example
- AI solutions

        - Overview of AI
        - Expert solutions positioned as one of the easiest AI technologies to program (times have shifted)


## Example activities

- And onto [CS First](https://csfirst.withgoogle.com/c/cs-first/en/curriculum.html)
- Provides a variety of interfaces and lessons for scaffolding the learning of computer science
    - Special version of the scratch editor
        - Everything on screen is a sprite
        - Sprites wear costumes

- [Pencil Code Gym](https://gym.pencilcode.net/draw/#/draw/first.html)
    - browser-based tutle graphics

### Automation context

- Digital system solutions

    - Process data in binary; made of _hardware_, controlled by _software_, connected to form _networks_ (sub-strands)
    - digital systems part of K&U
    - data representation linked to Aboriginal calendars as example of using different representations
    - [TED-Ed - Inside your computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkFi90lZmXA)
        - [Binary in 100 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDNaUi2cjv4) - fireship thanks youtube algorithm

- Input solutions

    - various type of input hardware - instructions & data to digital devices
    - pedagogical tools 

        - circuit boards: Makey Makey, CodeBug, Arduino. 
        - educational kits: Circuit Scribe, [LittleBits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUUsJSDa7PE) 
        - single board micro-computers: RasberryPi, [BBC:MicroBit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wuza5WXiMkc)
    - sensors of various types 
    - circuit boards may require soldering - but cheaper than education kits

- Automation solutions

    - algorithmic processes can be automated - all about the orchestration
        - observation: technology is more and more replacing the human
    - positions the importance of students being able to create solutions
        - observation: my personal practice, etc.
    - home automation - [iftt](https://ifttt.com/) as an example and their site includes social media related examples, now supporting the "no code" brand
        - observation: the IFTTT structure provides a possible framework for students listing their problems/solutions

- Robot solutions

    - one of the original algorithmic automation tool
    - examples: robot arms, 3d printers in cakes/pizzas, mobile robots,
    - robot tools for education

        - Younger years: Beebots, Bluebots, Probots; Oz-bots - limited problem solving capability; Dash and Dot robots; Sphero robots.
        - Older years: Lego Mindstorms, Edison Robots, Vex, etc.
        - [Gears Robot simulator](https://github.com/QuirkyCort/gears) - Open source, browser based robot simulator somewhat based on the Mindstorms environment, including Python etc links - [available online](https://gears.aposteriori.com.sg/) - could be used for competively (e.g. sumo competitions)

- Drone solutions

    - Solutions to problems from pizza delivery, surveillance, personal cinematography, global war on terror
    - Focus on drones that can be programmed
    - use to teach programming
    - Require awareness of drone rules from the Civil Aviation Authority 
        - inside basically okay (standard risk management with flying objects)
        - outside - cannot be flown within 30m of other people e.g. student drone operators are 30 m from you

### Information context

- Data acquisition solutions

    - integrated with stats from mathematics
    - data logging - systematic collection of data using a digital device
    - data as digital
        - various aspects of how its handled, checksum, synchronisation, compression
        - [STudio code org text compression lesson](https://studio.code.org/s/text-compression/lessons/1/levels/1) - tool to test/demonstrate compression on text

- Data representation solutions

    - whole numbers for data
    - data type changes operations
    - [School catchment data](https://www.qgso.qld.gov.au/maps/edmap/)

- Data interpretation solutions

    - extracting meaning from data - maths & stats
    - drawing on and using examples from "bad charts"
    - [Name age calculator](http://randalolson.com/name-age-calculator/index.html?Gender=M&Name=David) - how to tell someone's [age from their name](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-to-tell-someones-age-when-all-you-know-is-her-name/)

- Geospatial data solutions

    - location data - can be linked to geography/HASS
    - mapping data combined with X to display different data depending on device location
    - beacons, RFID chips etc.

- Data privacy and security solutions

    - [How secure is my password](https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/)
    - [Have I been pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)
    - teaching the technical aspects of this (privacy/security) general capability
