### Coding contexts

AC link _create a designed solution_

Solution types

- Code solutions

    - Coding as instructional sequences to create solutions to problems
    - Programming languages treated as other ICTs (**big mistake - reprogramability is key **)
        - Makes the  point that coding is fundamental and required for all automation and information based solutions
    - being creative, solving problems, and develop innovative ideas is key
    - Year 7 focus coding to include iterations and branching
        - Block languages: Daisy, Blockley, [[Scratch]], Foos, or Mindstorms, https://groklearning.com appears to have integrated tutorials
        - Visualisations - flowcharts
    - project-based learning is useful - scaffold student progression - development of thinking skills

- Application solutions

    - software application - main type of coding solution
    - again emphasis on solving **real-world problems**
    - https://code.org - non-profit (US) for teaching computer science
      - includes Javascript applab - blockly/online environment 
      - [educator overview](https://code.org/teach) - detailed curricula

- website solutions

    - Basic overview pointing to [codetribe - 5 minute website tutorial](https://me.codetribe.com/rocket/C1/P0/T0)

- game solutions

    - Incorporating games can be challenging

        - Many types of games, students may only be interested in some 
        - Students can become focused on mastering gameplay, rather than coding/solutions
          - The need to create "solutions to a wider problem" also mentioned
        - Complexity of game development and students attempting to do more than they are ready for 
            - Solution being to scaffold engagement - modify, rather than create etc.
            - Points to [code.og Flappy](https://studio.code.org/flappy/) as an example
- AI solutions

        - Overview of AI
        - Expert solutions positioned as one of the easiest AI technologies to program (times have shifted)

- Drone solutions

    - Solutions to problems from pizza delivery, surveillance, personal cinematography, global war on terror
    - Focus on drones that can be programmed
    - use to teach programming
    - Require awareness of drone rules from the Civil Aviation Authority 
        - inside basically okay (standard risk management with flying objects)

## Pedagogy

- Activity based learning

- [[elemental-learning-design]]

- Project based learning

    - Build into the Technologies curriculum
    - Different methods

        - extrinsic Project Based Learning (ePBL)

            - Projects arise externally, pre-determined solutions, replication is that aim

        - intrinsic Project Based Learning (iPBL)

            - students choose solution path, perhaps also choice of problem

    - integrate project management into PBL - timelines, planning, stages, communication, collaboration

- Challenge based learning

    - Framework for learning while solving real-world challenges
    - collaborative, hands on requiring identificatin of Big Ideas, asking questions, discovery and solution

- Collaboration 

    - Should be taught in secondary
    - Benefits: broader range of skills, viewpoints, adaptability, can be more efficient

- Play based learning

    - self-chosen and self-directed
    - intrinsically motivated
    - guided by mental rules
    - imaginative

- Integration connections

## Assessment

[QCAA resources](https://www.qcaa.qld.edu.au/p-10/aciq/version-9/learning-areas/p-10-technologies/digital-technologies/digital-technologies-assessment-resources) including standard elaborations

- Recommended that teachers focus on assessing one or two content descriptions in one unit, with selected content descriptions that might also be covered from another learning area. Allowing teachers to _focus assessment_ and provide students _multiple opportunities_ to demonstrate achievement

## Achievement

- Achievement standards

- Work samples

- Design briefs

    - Presents the scope, audience and criteria for an effective design
        - project summary and background
        - target users 
        - design requirements 
        - proposed solution, and
        - resources and timeframe
    - enables clients to make sense of a designed solution and to understand how the designed solution will be achieved

- Assessing general capabilities

    - AC has 7 capabilities divided into two groups
        - support students to be successful learners: literacy, numeracy, digital literacy, critical and creative thinking
        - develop ways of being, behaving and learning to live with others: personal and social capability, ethical behaviour, intercultural understanding
    - embedded into learning area content descriptions
    - teachers are encouraged to 
      - model capabilities 
      - identify connections with capabilities
      - provide a variety of learning activities to support development
      - provide opportunities for students to practice as authentic elements of the learning area
      - provide feedback on progress
