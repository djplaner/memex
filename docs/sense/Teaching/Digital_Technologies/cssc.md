A representation of the cognitive loads for learning computer science.

| Activity | Description |
|---|---|
| **Copy code** | Students follow step-by-step instructions | 
| **Targeted Tasks** | Students complete a short task (e.g. coding or [[parsons-problems]]) |
| **Shared coding** | Teacher writes code which the students are asked to write the same program at the same itme
| **Project based** | Students are given a project with a goal | 
| **Inquiry based** | Studetns consider a question and attempt to develop a solution |
| **Tinkering** | Completely student-led programming efforts |
