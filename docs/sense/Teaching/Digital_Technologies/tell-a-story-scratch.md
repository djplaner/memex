title: Tell a story - Scratch
type: note
---
"Tell a story" is a tutorial from the [Scratch tutorial page](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=all)

Intro video very quickly goes through the process 

- Select a background 
- Choose a character 
- Give it dialogue 
- Add a second character and switch its orientation 
- Start them having a conversation introducing a wait
- much more about having to hide/show sprites, especially when running

Can see how this might get overly complicated for some folk.

## Considerations for use

- How many students have computers that function?
- What happens when the Scratch website is unavailable? 
  - Downloading the offline editor might help, and it has the tutorials
- How to introduce them to the various concepts?
    - Just let them go with the tutorial?
    - I do, We do (they work through tutorial), You do?
    - Use the story cards, maybe with a variation of I/We/You at the start and then other cards as they select?

- Can we organise for students to save their work?
