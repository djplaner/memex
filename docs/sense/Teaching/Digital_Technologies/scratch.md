A high-level, block-based, event-driven visual programming language designed for educational purposes (ages 8 to 16). Version 3.0 released in 2019

Name arises from DJ's practice of "scratching" - of clipping together vinyl records and manipulated to create new sound/music.

## Conceptual model

Primarily Scratch programming takes place on the [Scratch website](https://scratch.mit.edu/) but an offline editor is available for desktop and mobile devices. [Page from Maleny State School](https://malenyss.eq.edu.au/support-and-resources/parent-resources/scratch-from-m-i-t-media-lab) suggests most Education Queensland schools are using the offlien editor.

### Interface

The Scratch interface has three main sections:

1. Stage area 

   - where the results appear, using x,y coordinates with 0,0 being stage centre
   - All sprites' thumbnails listed in the bottom area
   - Select a sprite and apply blocks to the sprite

2. Block palette - where the available blocks can be selected
3. Coding area - where the instructions live - aka _script_

### Blocks

| Category | Notes |
| --- |  --- |
|  Motion | Movements of sprites like angles and directions. |
|  Looks | Controls the visuals of the sprite |
|  Sound | Plays Audio files and effects |
| Events | Event handlers and broadcasters. |
| Control | Conditionals, loops, and cloning. |
| Sensing | Sprites "Sprite (computer graphics)" can interact with other sprites, the mouse pointer, and the backdrop. |
| Operators | Mathematical operators, conjunctions, and comparisons |
| Variables and Lists  | Blocks to access and set variables. Cloud variables can be accessed by all running versions of the project. |
| My Blocks | User-defined functions, accessible as blocks. They have the option to run without a screen refresh. |
| Extensions | Extra blocks and features  |
