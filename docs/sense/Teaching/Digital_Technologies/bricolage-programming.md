Discussed by Turkle & Paper (1990) as a different approach to programming than the traditional structured approach. Mitchell & Bown (2013) position bricolage programming between the structured approach and the trial and error approach.

> the bricolage programmer as one who constructs theories by arranging and rearranging; negotiating and renegotiating with code. This approach exists between a structured formation of code and a creative trial-and-error process: Reas, co-creator of Processing, describes writing software as "a process of translating fuzzy ideas from one's mind into a strict notational system. Using this notation as an intermediate step, visual and kinetic ideas manifest themselves in computational machines" (Reas, 2003).
