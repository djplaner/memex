Builds off the [[use-modify-create]] strategy and [[the-block-model]] to place a focus on reading and understanding code before writing it (e.g. [[use-modify-create#tipp--see]])

| Stage | Description |
|---|---|
| *P*redict | Students received a prepared program and predict what it will do perhaps using think-pair-share or small groups. Discussion between students is good |
| *R*un | Students test their predictions by running the program and verbalise the results and compare with predictions  |
| *I*nvestigate | Based on [[the-block-model]] students use code tracing, explaining, annotating, and debugging to explore the program |
| *M*odify | Equivalent to the modify stage in [[use-modify-create]] |
| *M*ake | Students are given a new problem to solve using similar ideas/skills |
