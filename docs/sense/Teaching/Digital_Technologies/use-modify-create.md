A learning progression suggested as a good example for lesson design.

| Stage | Description |
|---|---|
| **Use** | Students are introduced to an exemplar program similar to their ultimate task and learn how to use it effectively |
| **Modify** | Students modify the program to perform a different/but similar task | 
| **Create** | Students create a program from scratch to perform a related task |

## TIPP & SEE

A related idea designed specifically for Scratch. Both in terms of relying on the Scratch project page for code that students will explore and terminology/concepts from Scratch.

Students start on the Scratch project page and find a project that interests them

- TIPP

    1. **T**itle - what is the title of the project? Does it tell you something about the project?
    2. **I**nstructions - What do the instructions tell you to do?
    3. **P**urpose - What is the purpose of this activity? What will this code teach you? 
    4. **P**lay - Run the project and see what it does! Which sprites are doing the actions?

- SEE 

    1. **S**prites - Click on the sprite that you want to learn from or change.
    2. **E**vents - look at the event blocks starting the scripts. Which scripts are most useful?
    3. **E**xplore - Try different changes to the scripts and observe what happens
