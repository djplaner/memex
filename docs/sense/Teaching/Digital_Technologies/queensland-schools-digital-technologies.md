[Qld DoE page](https://education.qld.gov.au/curriculum/stages-of-schooling/stem/technology) offers rationale and description of what students will learn re: digital technologies.

Rationale is older (2015) data suggesting by 2020 90% of the Oz workforce will require digital skills in their roles. 60% of students are working toward jobs that will be largely automated - all pre-generative AI.

What students are learning includes:

- Years 7 and 8 - developing [[computational-thinking]] as well as communicating/collaborating online
- Years 9 and 10 - solving complex problems by creating digital solutions - creating sustainable digital solutions such as data drive websites and AI.

Largely driven by Australian Curriculum
