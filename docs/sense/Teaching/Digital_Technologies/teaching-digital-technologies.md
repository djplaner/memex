- ## Societal

    ---

    Broader societal teaching/digital technologies

    ---

    - Remedying the [[current-digital-dark-age]]
    - Avoiding [[program-or-be-programmed]]
    - [[technology-changes-us]]
    - [Center for Inclusive Computing](https://cic.northeastern.edu/)
    - [[creative-coding]]
    - [esif.dev](https://esif.dev/) - a historical record of foundational web development blogs

    School
    
    - [Digital Technologies Hub](https://www.digitaltechnologieshub.edu.au/) - Oz govt funded, all things related to teaching digital technologies - including scope and sequence - [[unpicking-digital-technologies-hub]]

    - [[digital-technologies-structures]]
    - [Grok Academy - unpack the curriculum](https://grokacademy.org/a/curriculum/)

- ## Philosophy 

    ---

    Broader theories on learning, teaching and digital technologies

    ---

    - Making and tinkering (DiGiacomo & Gutierrz, 2016) talk about benefits of making/tinkering

      Could be related to problem/exploration in mathematics teaching

- ## Pedagogy (conceptual)

    ---

    More specific conceptions of teaching digital technologies
