## To do


## DoE vision

2023/2024 vision titled _Equity and Excellence: realising the potential of every student_

## 2024 onwards Curriculum

[P-12 Curriculum assessment and reporting framework](https://education.qld.gov.au/curriculums/Documents/p-12-curriculum-assessment-reporting-framework-version9.pdf) - September 2023

## [Digital innovation in teaching and learning](https://education.qld.gov.au/initiatives-and-strategies/strategies-and-programs/equity-and-excellence/digital-innovation-in-teaching-and-learning)

Apparent broad goal. Linked to the broader [digital strategy 2022-2026](https://qed.qld.gov.au/publications/strategies/digital-strategy) ("A great _digital future_ for every Queenslander"), including:

- core foundations;

    "maintain, codesign and build a reliable, agile, secure, and scalable ICT platform"

- business modernisation;

    "human-centered business systems, solutions and proceses...continuously improve..."

- modern learning

    "invest in our digital services and capability to further enable collaboration and innovation"

Almost standard ICT strategic plan.  Little L&T focused.
