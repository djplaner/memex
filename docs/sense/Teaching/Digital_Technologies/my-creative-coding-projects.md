## Ideas

### Teacher knowledge

Visually capture the messiness of the knowledge good teaching requires. Contrast/compare with the typical cleanliness/orderliness of more formal depictions of that knowledge. Both in terms of academic literature, but also school practices and policies 

### Technology, orchestration, weaving etc
