In my old age, I'm pondering 

## Coding

- Early explorations [[creative-coding-with-python]]

## Ideas

### Teacher knowledge

Visually capture the messiness of the knowledge good teaching requires. Contrast/compare with the typical cleanliness/orderliness of more formal depictions of that knowledge. Both in terms of academic literature, but also school practices and policies 

### Technology, orchestration, weaving etc

With [[gatherers-weavers-augmenters]] becoming a key lens I see the world through, how might this be visually/creatively represented?
