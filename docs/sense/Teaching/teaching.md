# Teaching 

See also: [[learning]], [[design]]

Collection of resources, ideas etc around secondary teaching.

Structure inspired by [[goodyear-patterns-design-practice]] description of the educational design problem space, mostly with some additions.

| Level | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Societal](#societal) | Various events and beliefs from broader society about teaching and teachers |
| [Pedagogical Philosophy](#philosophy-declarative) | beliefs about how people learn, how people should be treated, what knowledge consists of (e.g. instructivism, constructivism) |
| [High level pedagogy](#high-level-pedagogy-conceptual) | focuses attention on particular conceptual frames and activities that are more effective for implementing a particular philosophy, not a lot of specifics (e.g. Cognitive Apprenticeship, PBL). Without direct prescriptions for action, but highlights "appropriate" action |
| [Pedagogical strategy](#pedagogical-strategy-procedural) | abstract/strategic communication of plans for action, promoting communication and coordination |
| [Pedagogical tactics](#pedagogical-tactics-operational) | specific ideas for implementing strategy |

### Digital learning tools

- [Sugar Labs](https://www.sugarlabs.org/) - FOSS learning platform with activity focus and a [collection of available activities](https://activities.sugarlabs.org/en-US/sugar/) 
  - Offers some international/collaborative projects ([Dollar Activity](https://try.sugarizer.org/activities/DollarStreet.activity/index.html?aid=a342be3c-6eaa-4466-90ea-5cfea5005503&a=org.olpcfrance.DollarStreet&n=Dollar%20Street)) in turn based on a [CapMinder project](https://www.gapminder.org/dollar-street)
- [Practical Ed Tech](https://practicaledtech.com/)

## Disciplines

- [[teaching-mathematics]]
  - 9.2% fo students doing specialist maths in 2020 
  - In Qld Year 12, only ~30% girls in physics and 37% in specialist maths, 55% in math methods
  - why?
    - math anxiety 
      - Yr 8 girls 57% dislike, 44% of boys
      - Yr 8 girls 10% really like, 17% of boys
  - How?
    - Cites one school focusing on fun activities - engage
