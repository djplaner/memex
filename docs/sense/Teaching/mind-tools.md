# Mind Tools (and Mindstorms)




## Definintions

### Mindtools

> Mindtools are computer applications that, when used by learners to represent what they know, necessarily engage them in critical thinking about the content they are studying (Jonassen, 1996). Mindtools scaffold different forms of reasoning about content. That is, they require students to think about what they know in different, meaningful ways. (Jonassen et al 1998, p. 24)

Classes of mind tools
- Semantic organisation tools - databases, semantic networking, 
- Dynamic modeling tools - spreadsheets, expert systems, systems modeling tools, microworlds
- Information interpretation tools - visualisation tools
- Hypermedia - 
- Conversation tools

Rationale for using technology as Mindtools
- learning as designers
- knowledge construction, not reproduction
- learning with technology 
- (Un)intelligent tools
- distributing cognitive processing
- cost and effort beneficial



### Mindstorms

Arising from Papert's work with Logo with the aim of allowing "children to engage in learning  with computers in an active and meaningful way" (Yelland, 1995, p. 853)

> It highlights the conflicting nature of the results but suggests that the use of Logo may afford opportunities for children to explore mathematical ideas in ameaningful context and in doing so generate amore active exploration and understanding of concepts and processes inherent to the discipline (Yelland, 1995, p. 853)
