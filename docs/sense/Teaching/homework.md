> There is a lot of evidence that homework, of any form, is unnecessary or damaging;...But there is hope: schools that decide to end homework see no reductions in students’ achievement and significant increases in the quality of home life (Kohn, 2008).
> Research also shows that the only time homework is effective is when students are given a worthwhile learning experience, not worksheets of practice problems, and when homework is seen not as a norm but as an occasional opportunity to offer a meaningful task. (p. 46)
