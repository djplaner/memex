## Comparing growth and fixed mindsets

Campbell et al (2020, p. 29) offers the following comparison of behaviours characteristics of the two mindsets

| Category | A growth mindset person will ... | A fixed mindset person will ... | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| Challenges | Choose or value challenges that will lead to more learning. ‘I like a challenge.’ | Avoid challenges that may expose areas of weakness. ‘I like things I know I can do well.’ | 
| Persistence | Persist after setbacks, show resilience. ‘I’ll have to try harder or work differently.’ | Give up easily after setbacks, or become defensive, or helpless. ‘What’s the point in trying? I don’t have what it takes to succeed.’ | 
| Effort | Put effort into academic work. ‘Worthwhile learning usually requires hard work.’ | Avoid appearing to work hard as it suggests low ability. ‘Learning should be easy if you are intelligent.’ | 
| Praise | Give or value praise for effort over praise for talent. ‘Well done, great work.’ | Give or value praise for talent rather than effort. ‘You’re a star, you’re a winner, you’re a top student.’ | 
| Success of others | Learn from and feel inspired by the success of others. ‘I can try that.’ | Feel threatened by the success of others. ‘Will they make it harder for me to be seen as successful?’ | 
| Learning goals | See the goal of learning as improving performance. ‘What can I learn from the mistakes I made in the test?’ | See the goal of learning as showcasing performance. ‘High performance in a test shows that I am learning.’ |
