Summary/reflections on the third module in the CSER Math in Schools MOOC.

## Maths and numeracy in our world

Suggests maths and numeracy is all about connections across strands and an intrinsic part of cultures etc.

??? question "Where do you see mathematics in your local community?"

    A prompting question for this section. My answer (currently) harks back to the [[goompi-model]] and its conception of what mathematics is (start with definitions). Where the mathematics is seen in the community is where people have built the cultural/personal means to connect the real world with the mathematical world. Often those connections wht and representations of mathematical knowledge will not mirror exactly academic mathematical knowledge. And likely many people will not be aware of any resemblance between what they do and mathematics.

### The location

Gives examples of mathematics at home and in the local area. General point about being aware of what is specific about the community and leveraging that. e.g. travel times to school in a regional community.

Fits with the _reality_ of the Goompi model.

### The people

Fits with the _cultural bias_ but also _reality_ from the Goompi model. About being aware of what the culture and people need/bring with mathematics, but also showing students how people like them (or who they want to be like) value/use numeracy/mathematics.

### The global context

Points to some resources. And then onto some big discussion of the various cultural symbols/different approaches to mathematics/measurement across time and cultures.

Makes mention of [[pi-day]]

### Maths & numeracy outside/on country and place

Using physical _reality_ to connect with mathematics.  Explicitly links with work from Prof Chris Matthews, specific examples 

- geocaching - search for hidden location using GPS
- measuring garden conditions
- citizen science - collecting data
- measurements

## People in maths careers

Shows a view from the "Careers with STEM" folk - standard stock music with graphics

We need maths for shopping, cooking, sport, and then into careers.  Careers mapped against the AC and some of their people.  Links to more of the posters etc.

Links to [AMSI](https://amsi.org.au/) produced video with [more detailed example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o_dZxQYn1Y&t=155s) - see the [AMSI schools project](https://schools.amsi.org.au/) and [Careers in Maths](https://careers.amsi.org.au/)

### Mathematicians across the world

Provides a list of famous mathematicians as examples to inspire students/demonstrate impact etc.  The detail is a bit light.

- Pythagoras
- Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi - Hindu-Arabic numerals, arithmetic, algebra
- Ada Lovelace
- Katherine Johnson
- Raye Montague
- Terence Tao
- Cheryl Praeger (Toowoomba native, UWA mathematician)

### Classroom Activities

- Role models in mathematics

    Mentions (doesn't cite) research that projects where students research maths role models have positive impacts. Links to a [Spotlight on Women in Maths in Australia project](https://acems.org.au/Women-in-Maths-Spotlight)

- Who uses maths and numeracy

    Students research careers they are interested in and list the maths/numeracy skills required in those careers.

## The M in STEM education

Standard rhetoric about jobs market/innovation requiring STEM skills

> By 2030, workers will spend 77% more time using science and maths skills" - Foundation for Young Australians (2017)

??? question "What is they're currently spending 0 time?"

    77% of 0 is 0 🤭 

STEM as a way to develop "21st century skills".  

### Implementing STEM education

Multiple approaches, but some common features

- integration of at least two learning areas
- programs designed around real-world contexts/problems

Consider focusing on the "ways of thinking" underpinning the learning areas.  e.g. design, systems, computational thinking.

??? question "Is STEM is a band-aid for the limitations of the formal educational system?"

    STEM promotions pushes the use of real-world contexts/problems which merge separate (but only STEM) learning areas. i.e. pushing back against the traditions in schools to have pretend problems and to separate subjects into separate classes.

    Add in the _T_ in STEM standing for technologies. Which, if you follow [[drons-technology|certain views of technology]] includes just about every subject at school.

    There also seems to be a tension between the careers rationale for STEM and the focus on STEM as a "way of thinking"/way of develop "21c skills". First, STEM is really multiple ways of thinking. Second, the focus on jobs is potentially problematic. If you take the [[goompi-model]] abstraction STEM and its components are a set of abstractions. If we want 21c skills, don't we want people able to draw creatively and appropriately on all of those abstractions? Not just STEM, not just those apparently responsive to current economic need.

    Why not focus on providing students with learning experiences that develop their ability to draw on all of these abstractions in ways meaningful to their reality?

### What can I do to connect maths

Inspired by the last module, I'm keen to leverage the [[goompi-model|Goompi Model]] as a guide for planning, graphic organiser, and a source of student input. The idea being to build up (shared) knowledge of the the parts of "reality" of interest. Perhaps leveraging that knowledge (with students) to develop generative themes to underpin design for learning. From there weave connections between mathematics and that "reality" in various ways through stories, resources (e.g. prompts for [[notice-and-wonder|Notice and wonder tasks]]), and activities.

#### Students inner circle

Connecting with the students "reality of interest" is a start. To engage friends and family perhaps the main strategy would be to aim to use mathematics to enable students to construct new or interesting insights or cultural/creative artefacts around their "reality of interest". Objects that will encourage and help the individual student share with their friends/family.

Build on a class norm about the importance of asking questions with a regular activity that encourages students to ask questions of a mathematical type about their realities of interest. 

#### To our community

As a member of the community, demonstrate the asking of mathematical questions by identifying mathematical questions from the local community (e.g. which is the cheapest place to buy petrol?) and integrate the refinement and answering into lessons. Develop community-specific prompts (e.g. images of a local landmark) for [[notice-and-wonder|notice and wonder]] or [[contemplate-then-calculate|contemplate then calculate]] tasks. Leverage local data as examples/tasks in mathematics.  For example, use weather data from local climate station to explore measures of central tendency etc to answer questions like "Which January was hotter (1964 or 2024)?".

#### To the world

Make use of past resources from [[pi-day|PI Day]] to raise student awareness of students from other countries engaging with the same mathematics. Perhaps working towards students being more actively engaged with PI day. Link inner-circle and community interests to world-wide projects (e.g. UN Sustainable Development Goals). Moving towards enabling the students to use mathematics to  [[reading-and-writing-the-world-with-mathematics|read/write their world]].
