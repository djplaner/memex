title: Mathematically productive tasks
---
Rumack & Huinker (2019) cite (unavailable work) that routines become mathematically productive when they:

- make studentsâ€™ mathematical thinking visible; 
- require teachers to pay attention to, build on, and respond to student thinking; and 
- develop a collaborative classroom culture focused on sense making.
