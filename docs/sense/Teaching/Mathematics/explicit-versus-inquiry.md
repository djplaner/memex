# Explicit versus inquiry

See also: [[inquiry-learning]], [[explicit-teaching]]

When applied to learning mathematics - Boaler & Selling (2017) - describe the two approaches as _active engagement_ (inquiry) and _passive engagement_ (explicit) in mathematics.

## Findings/perspectives

Boaler (1998) reports on case studies from two schools (which I've chosen to equate to the two extremes)

- Traditional, textbook-based (explicit?) teaching - "students developed a procedural knowledge that was of limited used to them in unfamiliar situation" - with a significant literature available to support this.
- Open-ended activities (inquiry) - "developed a conceptual understanding that provided them with advantages in a range of assessments and situations"

Boaler & Selling (2017) found that students from the open-ended activities school - as adultes - "move into significantly more professional jobs, despite living in one of the lowest income areas of the country". That the two different approaches led to very different relationships with mathematical knowledge as adults.

Fry and Hilman (2018) describe the growing prevalence of discourse around the effectiveness of explicit instructions from the mid-2000s and briefly summarises literature citing some of its limitations. The Boaler articles include mention of this with additional literature.

- procedural lessons increase student disengagement
- explicit teaching limits students' opportunities to exercise conceptual agency
