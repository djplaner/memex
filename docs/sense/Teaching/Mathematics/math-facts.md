# Math Facts



e.g. 8 x 4 = 32 is a mathematical fact.

Boaler (2015) suggests that "many people believe that it is not possible to think conceptually about mathematics all of the time because there are lots of math facts that have to be memorised" (p. 37)

## Learning math facts

Boaler (2015) suggests that learning math facts in isolation is problematic as it creates the impression that maths is about memorisation, static facts. Instead suggesting that these are "best learned through the use of numbers in different ways and situations" (p. 38). She later links this with the idea of how we learn about words. But using them in many different situations and ways (talking, reading, writing). Comparing time testing of math facts with English teachers not doing the same with words.

Boaler (2015) identifies time testing (often early testing of mathematical facts) as the beginning of math anxiety and mentions work that found math facts being held in working memory which is negatively impacted during periods of stress (e.g. timed tests)

Some people are better memorisers. In maths they can be deemed to have more ability (Supekar et al, 2013) - which is not the case
