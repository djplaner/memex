# ALIVE

See also: [[teaching-mathematics]], [[mathematical-resilience-classroom-environment]], [[TIRED]]

De Geest & Lee (2019) define ALIVE teaching as 

- **A** accessible
- **L** linked
- **I** inclusive
- **V** valuable
- **E** engaging

Perhaps to avoid the perception that classroom activities are [[TIRED]]

## Methods to bring a classroom ALIVE

- Be less helpful
- Build confidence

    Bandura's suggestions for building self efficacy

    - create experiences that require effort and overcoming struggle
    - share role models who have achieved that
    - create a social environment where mistakes are natural and important 
    - help interpret emotions during struggle as normal
- Understand and manage emotions

## Making mathematics activities come ALIVE

### Accessible

Links to the ideas of [[low-floor-high-ceiling-wide-walls]]

### Linked

i.e. helping students see a link between mathematical topics that often disconnected in the curriculum. De Geest & Lee (2019) give the example of factors, multiples, HCF and LCM of numbers. Introduced in one year, but not used extensively until later.

Highlighting a connection to some of the work around [[exploring-australian-curriculum]]

The examples given here also (IMHO) have echoes of [[productive-failure]]

### Inclusive

Suggest making greater use of activities that require use of physical senses 

- hearing patterns in a sequence
- feeling the length and other measures
- physical manipulation

Echoing ideas of [[enactive-mathematics-pedagogy]]. Reminiscent of the CPU schedule demo in OS. Gives example activity graphing student shoe sizes using their bodies.

Beyond this would the wide walls of [[low-floor-high-ceiling-wide-walls]]

### Valuable

Students see the point and value the mathematics they are doing/learning. Picks up on the point that students - through a lack of mathematical knowledge and examples from others about the utility of mathematics - will not see the utility/value of mathematics in the every day world

Suggest "value" for pupils comes through "links to ideas that are interesting to hem, that cause them enjoyment and that they consider to be worth heir attention"
