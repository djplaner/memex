# Checks for pedagogy



Checklist for pedagogy in mathematics teaching offered by Grant Sanderson in a talk titled [_Math's pedagogical curse_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOuxo6SA8Uc)

- Are core ideas given diagrams? see [[dual-coding]]
- Are new abstractions preceded with concrete examples?
- Does the lesson start with a motivating question?

Mentions ideas related to [[low-floor-high-ceiling-wide-walls]], particularly Boaler's description of 'low-threshold, high-ceiling tasks'

## Levels of abstraction

The following example (subset) of layers of abstraction is given. The example given moves from algebra down to numbers and quantities before engaging with algebra.

## Motivating questions

This practice is linked to the idea of [[productive-failure]]
