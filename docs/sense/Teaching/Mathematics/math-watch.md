# Math Watch 

See also: [[teaching-mathematics]]

Idea of encouraging student engagement in mathematics by identifying common misuses of mathematics in the general media and other daily practices. 

## Examples 

- [Exponential Growth](https://fosstodon.org/@nicemicro/110330035615075771)

> "it went from zero dollars spent [...] to billions of dollars spent now, a truly exponential growth" No.  You can't go anywhere from zero in an exponential fashion. Exponential growth from zero will be just.... zero. For ever.
