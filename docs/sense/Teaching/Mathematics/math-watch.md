Idea of encouraging student engagement in mathematics by identifying common misuses of mathematics in the general media and other daily practices. Original idea rose out of a [unit plan](https://djon.es/blog/2011/09/21/the-final-plan-khan-academy-gamification-and-the-flipped-classroom/) I developed during my Grad Dip. Inspired by the [ABC Australia TV show _Media Watch_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Watch_(TV_program) but with a focus on examining the use of mathematics in "real life".

    Newspaper article reporting on a report from ACOSS and UNSW. Finding that "income inequality has remained relatively steady, wealth inequality has increased over the past 20 years". Researchers then offer some solutions to this. Bits of the data are described

    - The wealthiest 20% on average are worth $3.2m (2019) (6 times the middle, 9 0 times the lowest 20%)
    - Middle 20% on average $588,000
    - Wealthiest 5% on average $6.7m - holding 1/3 the country's wealth
    - Wealthiest 20% hold 82% of all investment property and 78% of all shares/financial investments
