A (ever-)growing set of ideas.

To do

- [ ] School resources for

    - Makey Makey, Arduino etc, sensors, robots etc - input/output devices
        - Alternative use of mobile phones (possibly questionable from data privacy etc)

- [ ] Explore approaches to project-based learning


## Philosophy

- [[my-teaching-philosophy]]

- focus on making, design on [[digital-humanism]]
- make it impactful and cool
- a dual focus on learning how to

    - go through the process of design, iteration etc
    - learn the technical K&U
        - [[pedagogy-before-technology#Play with your materials|Play with your materials]]
        - which links somewhat to effectuation and building capital


## Idea bank

### Unifying/underlying practices

From the very earliest lessons embed certain language, practices and processes into what I do

- Design thinking steps from [[unpicking-technologies-education]] or similar
- Rubberducking with code and examples
- me having code and digital solutions I'm working on - having a process to share them

Encourage _C3 B4 ME_

### Identify problems of interest and impact

The ability to "solve problems" is positioned as important in the learning area. Have observed difficulties with students finding problems that are of the right type of interest and relevant to the curriculum needs. Which in turn link to the _investigating and defining_ strand (e.g. [[AC9TDI8P04]])

Suggesting a need to develop

- a bank/rubric/structure for identifying and thinking of problems.
    - Remind me of birthdays etc.
- a math watch like activity where students are encouraged to track needs/problems of people in their everyday life and report them.

### Platforms

- [Block based programming](https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/tlcs/3-cs-teaching-approaches/03-block-based-programming/index.html)

    Provides a good overview of various block programming environments
