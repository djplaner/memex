A (ever-)growing set of ideas.

To do

- [ ] What is the whole school plan for digital technologies?
- [ ] School resources for

    - Makey Makey, Arduino etc, sensors, robots etc - input/output devices
        - Alternative use of mobile phones (possibly questionable from data privacy etc)
    - [Audit technology access](https://www.digitaltechnologieshub.edu.au/plan-and-prepare/school-implementation/how-to-audit-school-resources/)

- [ ] Explore approaches to project-based learning
- [ ] [Digital Technologies Hub AI PD](https://www.digitaltechnologieshub.edu.au/understanding-dt/professional-learning/ai-professional-learning/ai-professional-learning-secondary-teacher/)


## Philosophy

- [[my-teaching-philosophy]]

- focus on making, design on [[digital-humanism]]
- make it impactful and cool
- a dual focus on learning how to

    - go through the process of design, iteration etc
    - learn the technical K&U
        - [[pedagogy-before-technology#Play with your materials|Play with your materials]]
        - which links somewhat to effectuation and building capital


## Idea bank

### Creative Coding

As a potential theme, [[creative-coding]] offers an application of digital technologies that are a little more creative and out of the ordinary than others (e.g. not gaming). Also potentially offers ways to touch on the key concepts of digital technologies, including:

- data representation 

    e.g. [poster](https://www.digitaltechnologieshub.edu.au/media/3fuctust/data-representation_a3_webyr7-10.pdf): bitmaps and visualising sound

- [Turtle Art Tile project](https://billkerr2.blogspot.com/2023/11/turtle-art-tile-project-conclusion.html) outcome of a project from Victorian teacher (blog post)

### Unifying/underlying practices

From the very earliest lessons embed certain language, practices and processes into what I do

- Design thinking steps from [[unpicking-technologies-education]] or similar - see [[unpicking-digital-technologies-hub]]
- Making the core concepts (see [[unpicking-digital-technologies-hub#Core Concepts]]) into artefacts and practices in the classroom
- Rubberducking with code and examples
- me having code and digital solutions I'm working on - having a process to share them

Encourage _C3 B4 ME_

### Identify problems of interest and impact

The ability to "solve problems" is positioned as important in the learning area. Have observed difficulties with students finding problems that are of the right type of interest and relevant to the curriculum needs. Which in turn link to the _investigating and defining_ strand (e.g. [[AC9TDI8P04]])

Suggesting a need to develop

- a bank/rubric/structure for identifying and thinking of problems.
    - Remind me of birthdays etc.
- a math watch like activity where students are encouraged to track needs/problems of people in their everyday life and report them.

### Pedagogy 

See [[unpicking-technologies-education#Pedagogy]]

- examine the [unplugged resources](https://www.digitaltechnologieshub.edu.au/teach-and-assess/effective-pedagogies/teaching-unplugged/)
- [formative assessment strategies](https://www.digitaltechnologieshub.edu.au/teach-and-assess/effective-pedagogies/formative-assessment-strategies/)
- [Raspberry PI quick read on understanding program comprehension](https://raspberrypi-education.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Quick+Reads/Pedagogy+Quick+Read+12+-+Block+Model.pdf) - [[the-block-model]]

### Platforms

- [Block based programming](https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/tlcs/3-cs-teaching-approaches/03-block-based-programming/index.html)

    Provides a good overview of various block programming environments

- [Github Global Classroom](https://docs.github.com/en/education/explore-the-benefits-of-teaching-and-learning-with-github-education/github-global-campus-for-teachers/about-github-global-campus-for-teachers) - get free copilot?
- [Code Puzzle](https://www.codepuzzle.io/) - Parsons problems
- [Python Tutor](https://pythontutor.com/python-compiler.html#mode=edit) - can visualise python code
- [App Inventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu/) - create IoS and Android apps
