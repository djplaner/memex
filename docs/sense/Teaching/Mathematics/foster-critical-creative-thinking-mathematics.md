## 7 Methods

[Source](https://www.monash.edu/education/teachspace/articles/seven-reasons-why-maths-is-important-for-21st-century-thinking)

1. Encourage students to figure out the answers, rather than telling them.
   1. Move from stuffing head with knowledge and allow students to discover -- _a balance?_
2. Tasks about mathematical reasoning produce more lightbulb moments
   1. Generate examples, analyse and notice patterns - look for similarities/differences/how to test 
   2. **Given the opportunity for students to discover**
3. Foster collaboration and communication through group tasks and teacher prompts
   1. Use "convince me" as challenging prompt
4. Like it or live it: it's part of the curriculum
   1. Linking creativity/critical thinking with maths
   2. Creativity - notice relationships between common properties and create rules/conjectures to test 
   3. Crticial thinking - testing these ideas required to convince others, justify
5. A rubric to help teachers assess three key areas 
   1. Brief discussion of a three item rubric: analysing, generalising, justifying
6. Problem-solving and reasoning are two different things
   1. Creativity == interpret the problem and make choices about a solution
   2. Critically - when justifying an interpretation fo the problem and evaluation of the solution
7. Creative and critical thinking are fundamental skills for the future
   1. Normal creativity justification - in Maths, start by teaching problem solving and reasoning
