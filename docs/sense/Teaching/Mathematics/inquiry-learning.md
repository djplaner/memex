## Guided inquiry

Fry & Hillman (2018) talk about guided inquiry as includes opportunities (necessity) for explicit teaching. As opposed to the common positioning of inquiry learning as leaving students to sink or swim without guidance.

> Guided inquiry presents contextualised investigations that include ambiguity to open pathways for solving the problem and to open up ways to answer the question with students making decisions about how they navigate the problem-solving process (Makar, 2012).
