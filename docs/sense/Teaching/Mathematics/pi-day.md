[International Day of Mathematics](https://www.idm314.org/) is celebrated on March 14th each year. The date is chosen to match the first three digits of the number pi (Ï€). But of course illustrates the role cultural symbols play in connecting mathematics with the the real world. i.e. it uses a date format that [is almost exclusive to the USA (M-D-Y format)](https://www.trustedtranslations.com/blog/how-are-dates-written-in-different-countries) with Y-M-D being used in Japan, China, the Koreas, Taiwan, Hungary, Lithuania and Iran.

A different theme is chosen each year.
