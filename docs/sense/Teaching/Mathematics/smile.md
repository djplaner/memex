[SMILE (Secondary Mathematics Individualised Learning Experience)](https://www.stem.org.uk/resources/collection/2765/smile-cards) was a UK project arising in the 1970s intended to enable a more individualised journey through mathematics for students. Collectives of teachers developed and reviewed individual activities (cards) that students could complete at their own pace with some requiring working with a partner.

Povey (2014) describes her experience being involved.

- Moving from a bite-sized curriculum focus for her cards to more problem solving/discovery
- a project driven by consensus not traditional elected hierarchies
- a project based on respect for teachers
- if starting over, would include emphasise more whole class activities
- fondly recalling the excitement of young people working co-operatively and independently in SMILE classrooms
- a vision of "co-operation, mathematical excitement, mutuality and real learning"

## Available resources

[Website](https://www.stem.org.uk/resources/collection/2765/smile-cards) provides access to cards, booklets and supplementary materials from the project in the following collections

- Number 
- Algebra
- Shape and space
- Handling data

For example, [area and perimeter](https://www.stem.org.uk/resources/elibrary/resource/32145/area-and-perimeter) with three packs with multiple cards.

A quick look suggests some utility, but not a lot that would be describes as [[low-floor-high-ceiling-wide-walls#mathematics]]. Though some [are better](https://mathybeagle.com/2014/05/09/tbt-math-smile-cards/).  But the idea of providing student choice, might be interesting.
