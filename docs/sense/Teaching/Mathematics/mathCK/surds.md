Numbers left as square (or other) roots because they/that give irrational numbers. A number that can't be written as a fraction. A number in decimal form that has no recurring pattern.

Any number of the form $\sqrt{a}$, which cannot be written as a fraction of two integers is called a #surd. There is no specific numeric value, at best approximations.

- The [_Golden Ratio_](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/nature-golden-ratio-fibonacci.html) is one of the earliest and most famous surds discovered by the Greeks (and perhaps others?)

## Declarative knowledge

### Surds and definitions

- _surd_
- _like surd_ and _unlike surd_
- _conjugate surd_

### Basic rules

- For positive numbers, squaring and taking a square root are _inverse processes_

    - $(\sqrt(a))^2 = a$
    - $\sqrt(a^2) = a$

- Multiplication

    - $\sqrt(a) \times \sqrt(b) = \sqrt(ab)$
    - $a\sqrt(b) \times c\sqrt(d) = ac\sqrt(bd)$

- Division 

    - $\sqrt(a) \div \sqrt(b) = \sqrt(a/b)$
    - $a\sqrt(b) \div c\sqrt(d) = \dfrac{a}{c}\sqrt(b/d)$

- Addition and subtraction of like surds
    - $a\sqrt(b) \pm c\sqrt(b) = (a \pm c)\sqrt(b)$


## Procedural knowledge

Simplifying means trying to 

1. Reduce the size of the number under the square root sign (_radicand_).

    By identifying and factors that are perfect squares and taking them out of the square root sign.

2. Reduce the number of square root signs.

    By looking for _like_ surds.

3. Remove and surds on the denominator of a fraction.

    By used of _conjugate surds_ and the _difference of squares_ identity.
