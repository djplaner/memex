## Definitions

A _quadratic_ is an expression of the form $ax^2 + bx + c$ where $a, b, c$ are constants and $a \neq 0$.

## Why?

Related to linear equations where _solving a linear equation_ focuses on isolating the unknown. Making it easier to identify the solution.

!!! info "Isolating the unknown doesn't work for quadratics"

Quadratics aren't overly obvious in everyday life, but are used in advanced mathematics.

## Declarative knowledge

A _quadratic_ is an expression of the form $ax^2 + bx + c$ where $a, b, c$ are constants and $a \neq 0$.

The _standard form_ of a _quadratic equation_ takes the form

$ax^2 + bx + c = 0,$ where $a, b, c$ are constants and $a \neq 0$$.

The aim is to find the value of $x$ that makes the equation true. These are the _solutions_ to the equation. 

_Quadratic equations_ can have 0, 1 or 2 solutions.

The constants $a, b, c$ are also known as the _coefficients_.

## Procedural knowledge

### Simplifying quadratic expressions

Prior to solving a quadratic equation, it is often useful to simplify the expression by

- Remove a negative $a$ by multiplying through by $-1$
- Remove any fractions for $a$ and $b$ by multiplying through by the lowest common denominator
- Reduce by any common factor to make the coefficients as small as possible
- Rewriting equations that are not in the standard form

### Solving variations of quadratic equations

#### Quadratic equations with no term in $x$

Can be done with simple isolation - similar to linear equations

#### Quadratic with no constant term

One of the solutions will be $x = 0$ and the other will be the solution to the linear equation $ax + b = 0$.

### Solving quadratic equations with three terms

Three basic methods

1. [Factorisation](#factorisation)
2. [Completing the square](#completing-the-square)
3. [Quadratic formula](#quadratic-formula)

#### Factorisation

Related to the method used to the use of the _zero product rule_ to help solve the "no constant" version.

When $a = 1$ then search for the factors of $c$ that add to $b$.

if $a \neq 1$ then find the factors of $ac$ that add to $b$

One way to check if a quadratic can be factorised is to use the _discriminant_. If the discriminant is a perfect square then the quadratic can be factorised. The discriminant is given by the formula $b^2 - 4ac$.

##### Cross method

A method for factorising quadratics that is often taught in schools. It is a method that is easy to teach and easy to learn. It is not a method that is used elsewhere in mathematics.

Form a x by

- Choose 2 factors of $a$ and place them in the top left and bottom left corners (include the x)
- Choose 2 factors of $c$ and place them in the top right and bottom right corners
- Multiply the factors across the x 
  - top left x bottom right
  - bottom left x top right
- Add the two products together to test if the result is $b$
- Write the factors from each row and then solve....**there's more here**

#### Completing the square

A more general method, especially when there are no common factors. A method that is used for other mathematical purposes. Will be needed elsewhere.

**lots more here**

#### Quadratic formula

Always works, by entering the values of $a, b, c$ into the formula

$$x = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

The discriminant is given by the formula $b^2 - 4ac$ and can be used to identify if there are solutions:

- If the discriminant is positive then there are two solutions
- If the discriminant is zero then there is one solution
- If the discriminant is negative then there are no solutions
