Commonly attributed to [Pythagoras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras#Attributed_discoveries) but had been known previously ([Babylonia](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/HistTopics/Babylonian_Pythagoras/), [Euclid](http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookI/propI47.html), [China](https://www.quora.com/If-the-Chinese-can-call-it-Gougu-theorem-why-is-it-wrong-to-refer-to-Pythagoras-theorem-as-Baudhayana-theorem-in-India), [India](https://www.cuemath.com/learn/baudhayana/)), but perhaps not necessarily proven.
