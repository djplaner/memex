## Motivation

Indicies provide an easy way to write repeated multiplication. 

A _logarithm_ is another name for an index. It answers questions like "What power of 2 gives 16?"

Uses of logarithms include

- decibels 
- the Richter scale
- pH value in chemistry

When two measured quantities are related by a power law, the parameters can be estimated using log plots - useful in experimental science


## Declarative knowledge

### Indices

A _power_ is a product of equal factors (known as the _base_). The number of factors is the _index_ or _exponent_.

Index laws

- $a^m \times a^n = a^{m+n}$
- $\dfrac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}, (provided m>n)$
- $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$
- $(ab)^n = a^nb^n$

### Logarithms

Taking a _logarithm_ is the inverse of taking a power.

Since $2^3 = 8$, then $\log_2 8 = 3$

To find the logarithm of a number $a$ to the base $b$, ask "what power do I raise $b$ to, in order to obtain $a$?"

The relationship between logarithms and powers is: $x = \log_a y$ if and only if $y = a^x$

#### Logarithm laws

Support $a > 0$

1. \(\log_a 1 = 0\) and $\log_a a = 1$

    - log base $a$ of nothing is $0$
    - log base $a$ of $a$ is $1$

2. If $x$ and $y$ are positive numbers, then $\log_a xy = \log_a x + \log_a y$

    - log of a product is the sum of the logs

3. If $x$ and $y$ are positive numbers, then $\log_a \dfrac{x}{y} = \log_a x - \log_a y$

    - log of a quotient is the difference of the logs

4. If $x$ is a positive number and $n$ is any number, then $\log_a \dfrac{1}{x} = -\log_a x$

    - log of a reciprocal is the negative of the log

5. If $x$ is a positive number and $n$ is any rational number, then $\log_a x^n = n\log_a x$

    - log of a power is the power times the log
