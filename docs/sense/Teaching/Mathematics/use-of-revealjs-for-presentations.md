The plan is to use [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) for teaching/presentations because

- It fits more with the whole [[digital-humanism]]/avoidance of [[enshittification|Platform decay]] - personally and as walking the talk
- For teaching, I'll be doing a lot of mathematics and code, which the MickeySoft tools don't do well

## Strategies

### Use of pandoc _deprecated_

To generate HTML files with reval.js presentations but which can be served via GH-pages

- All [reveal.js configuration options](https://revealjs.com/config/) can be set through variables (-V)
- YAML meta data block can also be used

See 

- [Gist](https://gist.github.com/jsoma/629b9564af5b1e7fa62d0a3a0a47c296)

    Include use of the CDN - https://unpkg.com/reveal.js/

- [reveal-hugo](https://github.com/dzello/reveal-hugo) - possible alternative to pandoc

**Deprecated** pandoc's conversion lost some of the important features. Too annoying.  Hence going full HTML

### Use of HTML

Current [test bed](../Implementation/2024/MAT081C/welcome.html)

To do

- [ ] Develop my css for patterns e.g. [this](https://chenhuijing.com/blog/customising-revealjs-beyond-theming/#%F0%9F%8E%99) or [this gist](https://gist.github.com/Myfanwy/00d5031c3c35d1370c8fc851c51dfc82)
