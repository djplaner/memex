The plan is to use [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) for teaching/presentations because

- It fits more with the whole [[digital-humanism]]/avoidance of [[enshittification|Platform decay]] - personally and as walking the talk
- For teaching, I'll be doing a lot of mathematics and code, which the MickeySoft tools don't do well

## Strategies

### Use of pandoc

To generate HTML files with reval.js presentations but which can be served via GH-pages

- All [reveal.js configuration options](https://revealjs.com/config/) can be set through variables (-V)
- YAML meta data block can also be used

See 

- [Gist](https://gist.github.com/jsoma/629b9564af5b1e7fa62d0a3a0a47c296)

    Include use of the CDN - https://unpkg.com/reveal.js/

- [reveal-hugo](https://github.com/dzello/reveal-hugo) - possible alternative to pandoc
