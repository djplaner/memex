Boaler (2015) identifies this as the "best strategy" she knows for teaching [[number-sense]] and [[math-facts]] at the same time. Apparently perfect as a lesson starter or for parents at home.

Method
> It involves posing an abstract math problem and asking students to show how they solve the problem mentally. The teacher then collects the different methods students give and looks at why they work. (Boaler, 2015, p. 48)

Example problem given is "15 x 12" which results in five different ways to solve it.
