De Geest & Lee (2019) introduce _mathematical resilience_ as "a positive stance towards mathematics" (echoing [[mathematical-mindset]]) which helps be able to (and believe they can) persist in becoming a successful learner of mathematics.

The cite Lee and Johnston-Wilder (2013) as identifying features of a classroom environment that helps with the development of mathematical resilience, including

- encourages a growth mindset 
- includes and values all pupils (discussions, relevant work)
- acknowledges mathematics is hard, that success is possible, avoiding rote learning
- show how to get help and support with their learning.
