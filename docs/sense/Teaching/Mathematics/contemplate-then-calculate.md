Mathematics pedagogical approach aiming to help students apply structural thinking. Avoiding the automatic application of procedures.

Simple summary/routine

- Notice
- Find calculation shortcut
- Share and study shortcuts
- Reflect on learning

## Routine

1. Launch routine 

    - Explain what, how, and why we're learning
    - Provide students with a calculation, expression, relationship to consider
    - Project the object for only 5-10 seconds and ask what do you notice 

2. Notice 

    - Shift focus away from calculation to interpreting the object
    - Perhaps an orienting question
    - solo thinking (5-10 seconds) and some initial sharing (15-30 seconds)
    - then shared with the group (2-3 minutes)

3. Develop shortcut

    - working in pairs students try to develop a shortcut (2-5 minutes)

4. Discuss shortcuts

    - shortcuts shared, discussion (5-10 minutes)
    - one pair explain
    - record the strategy to show evidence of properties, rules of operation, or relationships
    - prompt others to listen/look for how the pair used structure to find a short cut
    - provide short thinking time
    - Ask questions

        - How did this pair think about the task?
        - What did they pay attention to? How did that help them?
        - What properties, rules of operations, or relationships did they surface/levarge? How?

    - Ask others to explain why it's valid

5. Reflect on your thinking

    - Re-introduce why and what was done here - explain we're doing a write/pair/share
    - Write (1-2 minutes) prompting students to think/write about what they've learned structurally

        Observe writing, encourage specificity

          - One way to surface hidden structure is to...
          - You can find calculation shortcuts by...
          - The next time I will... before I calculate because...
          - A property that comes in handy when developing a shortcut is.. because..

    - Pair 

        - read written to a partner
        - identify reflections to share

    - Share

## Possible problems

- Reliance on noticing

    There is a line of thought amongst some that this is somewhat fraught/problematic. But that's perhaps where prompting comes in

- Preparation and enculturation

    Isn't going to happen over night. Leading up to it.
