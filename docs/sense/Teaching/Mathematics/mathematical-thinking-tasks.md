Liljedahl (2020)'s variation? on [[rich-mathematical-tasks]]

Thinking tasks create conditions where students:

- get stuck;
- experiment;
- might fail;
- apply knowledge in new ways (non-routine tasks)
- engage in a cross section of mathematics (or other curricular thinking)

Such tasks should have

- Highly engaging problems 
- and [[low-floor-high-ceiling-wide-walls]]

## Implementation and other types of task

Liljedahl (2020) describes three types of lesson type

| Lesson type | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 1. Non-curricular | Highly engaging thinking tasks, card tricks, and numeracy tasks are used without concern for curriculum. Echoing: [[inquiry-learning]], [[rich-mathematical-tasks]] etc |
| 2. Scripted curricular tasks | Curricular tasks are turned into problems, which are posed to students as building on previous work, but requiring additional learning.  Echoing [[productive-failure]] |
| 3. As-is curricular tasks | Standard direct or [[explicit-teaching]] of routines directly linked to curriculum goals. An approach that tends to promote "mimicking, not thinking" (p. 26) | 

Research suggests that students are more successful with the following sequence.

- Start with three to five thinking tasks (lessons?) - non-curricular
- Then shift to scripted curricular tasks

But both task types use a common process - teacher poses either task as a challenge
