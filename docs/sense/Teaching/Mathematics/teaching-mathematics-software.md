## GeoGebra

[GeoGebra](https://www.geogebra.org/about) is perhaps the best known and possibly most powerful. However, it's no longer open source and owned by a company. Initially, geometry and algebra with probably and others added

## SageMath

[SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/) is open source built on Python. Intended to be an FOSS alterantive to Mathematica, MatLab etc. i.e. usable for a broader range of maths than GeoGebra.

Use a browser-based notebook interface. Which means the interface for entry of mathematics isn't as user friendly. Edging somewhat into LaTeX land. Wondering if someone has addressed that? A high school focus seems to have fallen over.

## Demos

[Demos](https://www.desmos.com/) originally a graphing calculator, now includes scientific and matrix calculators, and an geometry tool. Lessons can be shared.
