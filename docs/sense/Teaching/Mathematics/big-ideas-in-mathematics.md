A way of seeing mathematics as coherent and connected whole. Rather than a collection of (apparently) disconnected topics. Big ideas run across traditional curricula strands.

> a statement of an idea that is central to the learning of mathematics, one that links numerous mathematical understandings into a coherent whole (Charles, 2005, p. 10)

Simeon (2022) suggests there is little agreement on what the mathematical big ideas are or how to use them in L&T. Beyond the idea that big ideas should be

1. Mathematically important; and,
2. Pedagogically important.

Simeon's (2021) bullet point summary 

- are “mathematically big, conceptually big, and pedagogically big” (Askew, 2015, p. 13), that is, they have a basis in mathematics but also in how mathematics is taught and learnt (Fosnot & Dolk, 2001; Watson et al, 2013) 
- involve semi-ordered structures of supporting, interrelated ideas and processes often described as maps, networks, or webs (Confrey et al., 2014; Hurst, 2019; Siemon, 2006; Van de Walle et al., 2010) 
- grow in depth and complexity over time as they are connected with other aspects of mathematics and as they are applied in a broader range of contexts (Hiebert & Carpenter, 1992; Ma, 1999; Mason et al, 2009) 
- provide a basis for a more coherent approach to the teaching and learning of mathematics that seeks to build connections, values multiple strategies and reasoning, and supports further learning with understanding (Confrey et al., 2017; Siemon, 2021; Siemon et al., 2012, 2019; Askew et al., 1997).


## Another form of technology?

For me, echoing Dron's [[drons-technology|definition of educational technology]] as per this quote and the following table

> Big ideas in mathematics providing an organising framework for teachers to think about their task as teachers of mathematics (Simeon, 2022, p. 2)

Though the purpose Simeon is suggesting appears a little narrow. Though subsequent mention of Clarke's et al (2012) idea that it's the enabling teacher conversations that are the real benefit.

| Dron | Big ideas |
| --- | --- |
| orchestration of | A _big idea_ specifies how different mathematical K&S are connected (orchestrated) into a bigger construct |
| phenomena | The mathematical K&S being orchestrated |
| for a purpose | The specific pedagogical context and purpose |




## Why?

QCoT (2015) suggest that big ideas help (Simeon, 2021 supports this and gives a citation): 

- teachers - mathematics to be more coherent; and, 
- students - to develop a deep understanding of mathematics and its applications. That seems an arbitrary distinction with both advantages apply universally.

Ma & Kessel (2003) argue that teachers require a fundamental understanding of mathematics in terms of four key features:

- connectedness,
- multiple perspectives,
- recurring basic ideas, and 
- longitudinal coherence

Australian Curriculum sees mathematics "of multiple but interrelated and interdependent concepts and systems". Which it apparently contributes to through four proficiency strands: understanding, fluency, problem solving, and reasoning. Currently associated under the considerations as part of _proficiency in mathematics_

Making connections between areas is one of the stated aims of the v9 oz curriculum. Askey et al (1997) found good teachers believing that being numerate requires "having a rich network of connections between different mathematical ideas". As opposed to "death by a thousand bullet points" of curriculum frameworks.

Simeon (2021) 

- Learning with understanding - echoing [[instrumental-relational-mathematics]]

    Organising into a conceptual framework supports greater transfer.

- Curriculum coherence

    "One of the most damaging aspects of school mathematics, particularly as it is represented in commercial texts and computer-based mathematics programs is the atomisation of the curriculum into a seemingly endless list of discrete ‘topics’ where ‘coverage’ becomes the major goal of planning, the predominant mode of learning is ‘example/demonstrate-practice-practice’, and the majority of those exercises remain as they were observed by Vincent and Stacey in 2008 as relatively low-level, skill based repetitious exercises." (Siemon, 2021, p. 8)


- Key to effective teaching 
- Impact student outcomes

### Teacher need

Kuntze et al (2011) and Clarke et al (2012) found that pre-service and in-service teachers need support in identifying, describing and linking important ideas in mathematics.

### Variations of school curriculum

Steen (1990) - 6 broad categories

- Quantity
- Dimension
- Pattern 
- Shape
- Uncertainty 
- Change

Rutherford & Ahlgren (1989)

- Numbers
- Shapes
- Uncertainty 
- Summarising data 
- Sampling 
- Reasoning

## Siemon (2022)

Links to the ideas of Bruner (1960) suggesting that without sufficient structure knowledge is likely to be forgotten. Echoing the Gee quote from [[how-learning-works]]. Uses the Charles (2005) definition of a big idea. In turn, Simeon uses the term _concept_ from Clarke (1997) as a "big idea that helps us make sense of, or connect, lots of little ideas."

With the number of connections related to the level of understanding.

Seeks to answer two questions

### What are Big Ideas in school mathematics and why are they important?

Variety of definitions. Diversity mapped using the dimensions of 

- size; and

    Some "big ideas" are seen as too "big" to inform teachers' everyday practice.

- mode of expression.

    Expressed as _concepts_ or _processes_. Processes seen as problematic. Related to how big ideas are identified: top-down leading to declarative statements from analysis of knowledge, bottom-up - expressed as evidence-based descriptions of concepts/processes over time..

### What implications do Big Ideas have for the teaching and learning of mathematics?
