This will never be finished. Perhaps not even particularly useful, but I need to start making concrete some initial ideas.

Probably also applicable to other subjects.

## Philosophy/assumptions

Starts with [[my-teaching-philosophy]] - essentially bricolagogy. 

Deal with the 

- practicalities of school teaching as a system of systems
- including the constraints of the curriculum, common approaches to teaching, conceptions of mathematics
- the huge diversity of students on numerous fronts, including the mathematical literacy/ability

## Tasks

- [ ] Identify specific set of norms

  - Link to school expectations

- [ ] Design themes/structures for units

- [ ] Refine activities

- [ ] Figure out effective, digital methods for production and support

### Principles

- create exciting mathematics environments
    - curiosity, connection making, challenge, creativity, collaboration
- give students the positive messages they need
- pique students' curiosity and interest
  - driving questions 
- integrate [[assessment-for-learning]] - [[data-informed-teaching]]

Aiming to help students develop a [[mathematical-mindset]] / [[mathematical-mindsets]]. Weave in principles from other work (e.g. the [GiST 7 principles](https://www.thegist.edu.au/educators/girls-in-stem/inclusive-classrooms/seven-principles-for-a-gender-inclusive-learning-environment/) and [Gutstein's reading and writing the world with mathematics (RWWM)](https://wordpress.oise.utoronto.ca/robertson/reading-and-writing-the-world-with-mathematics/)). 

Informed by [[abc-learning-design-and-acad]], [[needs-for-learning-design-systems]], [[evolution-of-design-for-learning]], [[norman-activity-centered-design]]

Beyond the norms/principles there will be a range of other insights/practices underpinning this approach. Possible examples include: lesson planning using [[productive-failure|productive failure]]; designing collaborative learning informed by [[complex-instruction|complex instruction]] and [[building-a-thinking-classroom|thinking classrooms]];  [[assessment-for-learning|assessment for learning]]; and leveraging digital technologies.

## Resource practices

- [[use-of-revealjs-for-presentations]] - thought is it may be nicer for code and mathematics, plus avoid MickeySoft


## Curriculum design

Take units of work and draw on mathematical big ideas and RWWM to create a structure for the unit's mathematical knowledge and skills (K&S) that is meaningful/accessible to students. Develop graphical organisers and other assessment for learning practices/resources that have the students actively engaged with the structure and their progress.

Search for problems/inquiry tasks

- [[resolve-mathematics-by-inquiry]]

## Activity Types

### Expectations

[math expectations](#math-expectations) - set, model, reinforce expectations

### starters

Move beyond just simple revision to integrate [[number-talks|number talks]] etc. designed to engage students more broadly in fundamental mathematical K&S.

### [[math-connections-activity-type]] 

Help students see connections within and outside of mathematics

Including stories about the history/use of mathematics (emphasising the purposeful development of abstract ideas).  Linked to [[effective-pedagogy-in-mathematics#Use tasks and resources to challenge and support students mathematics|ideas of using stories]] to help students understand mathematics.

### recognising/modelling tasks -- pick one of these - perhaps [[notice-and-wonder]]

- [ ] What about anyqs?

e.g. ["Which one doesn't belong"](http://wodb.ca/) (HT: [Janelle](https://canvas.catalog.adelaide.edu.au/courses/1042/discussion_topics/3098/entry-3745)), [[contemplate-then-calculate]], [What Can You Do With That (WCYDWT)](https://blog.mrmeyer.com/2010/wcydwt-car-talk/), or [[math-watch|Math Watch]]

### [[rich-mathematical-tasks|rich tasks]];

Tasks with a [[low-floor-high-ceiling-wide-walls|a low floor, wide walls, and high ceilings]] 

### "wax on, wax off" (Explicit teaching)

I suspect there will still be call (if only due to personal inertia) for explicit teaching/worksheets. Focused on mathematical K&S and perhaps other topics (e.g. brain science, growth mindset, the learning pit etc.). Hence give it a label that makes the purpose explicit.

### closers

Exit tickets or [others](https://www.edutopia.org/blog/22-powerful-closure-activities-todd-finley). 

## [homework](#homework) 

Focused on reflection, conceptual understanding, connections etc (not procedural)

## Other possible strategies

- Liljedahl's 

  - [lesson planning advice](explicit-versus-inquiry.md#a-different-approach-non-curricular-scripted-curricular-as-is-curricular) three/five non curricular, followed by scripted curricular
  - Random group work (Liljedahl, 2014) and ideas for thinking classroom (Liljedahl, 2020)

- Richland et al (2012) report on research focused on the two most common types of problem. But also note research that found the _making connections_ type problems can be turned into a _using procedure_.

  - Using procedures - students solve problems they've been taught to solve.
  - Making connections - problems where students struggle and are focused on making connections between concepts.


## Activity Types

Associated ideas: [Project Zero's Thinking Routine toolbox](https://pz.harvard.edu/thinking-routines)

The vague idea is to develop a small collection of common activity types - related by pedagogical purpose - that can be

1. Integrated into lessons as required, regardless of the broader pedagogical framework/approach
2. Perhaps eventually form the basis for a form of [[abc-learning-design-and-acad|activity based learning design]] for mathematics

### Math expectations

[[class-expectations]]

Purpose to reinforce the type of mindset/perception of students and mathematics

- growth mindset stuff
- sense of belonging in mathematics (Good, Rattan & Dweck, 2012)

### Homework

One of Boaler's suggestions

- What was the main idea you learned today?
- What is something you are struggling with or have questions about?
- How could the ideas from today's lesson be used in life?
