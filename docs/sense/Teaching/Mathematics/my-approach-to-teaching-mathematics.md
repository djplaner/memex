# My approach to teaching mathematics

See also: [[teaching-mathematics]]

This will never be finished. Perhaps not even particularly useful, but I need to start making concrete some initial ideas.

## Philosophy/assumptions

Starts with [[my-teaching-philosophy]] - essentially bricolagogy. 

Deal with the 

- practicalities of school teaching as a system of systems
- including the constraints of the curriculum, common approaches to teaching, conceptions of mathematics
- the huge diversity of students on numerous fronts, including the mathematical literacy/ability

Aiming to help students develop a [[mathematical-mindset]]

## Implementation

1. Identify a set of principles to guide the next step
1. Identify a common set of activity types for lessons (draw more on ABC Learning Design)

    - starters
        - retrieval
        - connections
    - content acquisition
    - inquiry learning - problems
    - worksheets
    - connections with mathematics/real world??
    - homework

1. Figure out effective, digital methods for production and support
