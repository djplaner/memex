title: Activity focused mathematics teaching (design for learning)
---

Nascent idea to underpin [[my-approach-to-teaching-mathematics]] on an activity centered design for learning approach. i.e. moving the focus beyond learning outcomes, curriculum, direct instruction, etc. and other reductionist assumptions toward are more socio-cultural ([[bad-mindset]]) approach.

## Theoretical underpinnings/connections

### Socio-cultural

Hernandez-Martinez & Pampka (2017) taking a socio-cultural perspective and citing Gresalfi (2009) talk about shifting from a focus acquiring/delivering the knowledge object toward a conceptualisation of learning that "shifts attention to the kinds of practices in which people participate, and the ways people come to related to one another within a particular activity setting (Gresalfi, 2009) cited in Hernandez-Martinez & Pampka (2017, p. 190). From which flows the idea that learners form _dispostions_ (i.e. ways of being in the world) through their participation in pedagogical practices.

Where disposition is defined as "a capacity to engage". A relational perspective linking the individuals "as _acting_ subjects and the affordances and restrictions that their sociocultural contexts post on them" (Hernandez-Martinez & Pampka, 2017, p. 190).
