## [Rich, relevant, and engaging tasks](https://emcf.weebly.com/rich-relevant-engaging-tasks.html) 

Six characteristics of rich tasks 

1. Accessibility - invite all learners to engage in and contribute
2. Real-life connections - authentic contexts for students will increase interest and creativity in solutions and strategies
3. Multiple approaches and representation - the more avenues for engagement, the more opportunities for success 
4. Collaboration & discussion - encourages students to engage in collaborative groups when they have reached an independent conclusion, encouraging reasoning and new perspectives
5. Engagement curiosity & creativity - when interested in the task learners demonstrate perseverance and work through challenges that arise
6. Opportunities for extension - all students engaged with challenges and extensions for those ready without pressuring others to hurry up

### Developing rich, relevant and engaging tasks

1. Start with a closed version of the problem

    $ \dfrac{1}{12} + \dfrac{5}{12} = \fbox{ } $

2. Open up the problem by removing or adapting parameters

    $ \dfrac{\fbox{ }}{12} + \dfrac{5}{\fbox{ }} = \dfrac{\fbox{ }}{2} $

3. Add complexity

    Two fractions add up to one half. What might those two fractions be?

4. Introduce a requirement for reasoning

    Two fractions add up to one half. What might those two fractions be? How many possible answers are there? Do you notice any patterns?


## Boaler (2015) - 6 questions to enrich learning tasks

Boaler (2015) provides the following 6 questions as a way of enriching mathematical learning tasks. A related idea are [[mathematical-thinking-tasks]]

### 1. Can you open the task to encourage multiple methods, pathways and representations?

- Add a visual requirement
- Ask students to make sense of their solutions

e.g.  $1 / \frac{2}{3}$ has extra requirements added

- make sense of your answer
- provide a visual proof

### 2. Can you make it an inquiry task?

Rather than reproduce a method, ask students to think about ideas and use a procedure.

Examples

- Rather than _find the area of 12 x 4 rectangle_, ask them how many rectangles they can find with an area of 24.
- Rather than name quadrilaterals with different qualities, ask them to come up with their own
- Ask students to make all the numbers between 1 and 20 using four 4s and any operation

### 3. Can you ask the problem before teaching the method?

Echoes of [[productive-failure]]

### 4. Can you add a visual component?

Diagrams or physical objects - multilink cubes, algebra tiles

Examples

- Have students show functional relationships in many forms: expression, picture, words, and a graph.  One school colour coded function components.  i.e. the $x$ always in red.
- Parallel lines and traversal - colour code different types of lines

### 5. Can you make it low floor and high ceiling?

- lower - ask students how they see a problem
- higher - ask students who finish to write a new question that is similar but more difficult

### 6. Can you add the requirement to convince and reason?

- ask students why the used a method and why it made sense
- three levels of convincing: yourself, a friend, a skeptic

Example - paper folding, working in pairs students must fold a piece of paper to meet some criteria (e.g. a square exactly 1/4 the area of the origin) and then convince their partner it is correct.
