## Summary of learning

Hodgen et al (2018) provide this summary

- Algebra is found to be difficult as it is abstract and symbolic.
- It is experienced as a collection of arbitrary rules and procedures, which are then misremembered or misapplied.
- both procedural and conceptual teaching approaches using explicit and problem-based learning provide benefit
- focus on the structure of algebraic representations
- when solving problems aid students to choose deliberately
- worked examples can be useful to appreciate algebraic reasoning and different solution approaches
