The core of mathematics is problem-solving and modelling the world around us.

## reSolve approach

Goal of inquiry is to encourage students to

- wonder,
- ask questions,
- seek patterns and explain solutions.

## Seven components of mathematical inquiry ([Inquiry maths](https://www.inquirymaths.com/home/an-inquiry-lesson))

### Question, notice and wonder

- Students attempt to understand the prompt by making an observation.
- Think individually before pairing up to share. 
- Each pair feeds back a question or comment to the class.
- Teacher aims to draw out relevant knowledge

| Posing questions | Notice and wondering |
| --- | --- |
| What does ... mean? | We notice that ... |
| Is it right than ...? | We know that .. because ... |
| How is it true that ...? | We think that ... because ... |
| Why is ...?  | We wonder whether ... |
| Would it be ... if ... ? | We can change ... |

### Establish aims and plan actions

- Reviews questions and observations, perhaps think aloud, perhaps commenting
- Students in pairs select a [regulatory card](https://www.inquirymaths.com/home/Regulatory-cards) and justify to a class how they'll direct the inquiery

### Explore and conjecture

- Students decided on period of exploration: generating more examples, find a case, make/test a conjecture
- STudetns work toward forming a generalisation

### Construct understanding

...

### Reason and prove

### Present results and findings

### Evaluate
