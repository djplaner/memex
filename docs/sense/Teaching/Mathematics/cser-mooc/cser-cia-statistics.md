### Introduction

> Statistics provides ways of understanding and describing variability in data and its distribution. Statistics provides a story, supports an argument and is a means for the comparative analysis that underpins decision-making and informs a process for making informed judgements. 

Statistical literacy 

- understanding of statistical information and processes 
- awareness of data
- ability to interpret, evaluate and communicate statistically
- provides a basis for critical scrutiny of accuracy/validity of arguments/representations

Sources of data IoT etc. Growing.

Connections with Digital Technologies could be useful - [[v9-learning-areas#Acquiring, managing and analysing data|year 8]] e.g. [[AC9TDI8P01]]

#### Key Terms

| Term | Definition | 
| --- | --- |
| **Bivariate data** | **Bivariate data** is the data for two variables, such as temperature and sunglasses sales, and shows how the variables are related. |
| --- |  --- |
| **Census** | A **census** is a collection from a whole population rather than a sample of the population. The census is run every 5 years in Australia.   |
| **Dependent variable** | The **dependent variable** is the variable that depends on another value, for example, the distance travelled is dependent on the amount of time spent driving. |
| **Distribution** | A **distribution** refers to how often data values occur. Often the plot of the distribution reveals a characteristic shape e.g. data may be normally distributed, or positively skewed.   |
| **Independent variable** | The **independent variable** is the variable that is manipulated in the experiment or data collection to investigate the effect on the dependent variable. For example, time is the independent variable when travelling.   |
| **Measures of central tendency** | **Measures of central tendency** include the mean, median and mode. The **mean** (average) is found by adding all the data values and dividing by the number of values. The **median** is the middle value when all data values are listed in order. The **mode** is the data value that occurs the most. |
| **Population** | A **population** is the complete set of individuals, objects, places etc. about which we want information.  |
| **Sample** | **A sample** is a selection from the population. The aim is for the sample to be representative of the population, so it needs to be random. |
| **Statistical investigation** | A scientific method of gathering data in order to seek meaning from observed phenomena and inform decisions and actions. |

### Guide

Statistical skills allow

-   determine the data needed to answer questions   
-   formulate data collection questions and strategies to acquire and record data  
-   represent categorical data using digital tools   
-   compare and interpret data using frequencies and common features which link to the questions posed   
-   use the data to make informed decisions.

#### Fundamentals

| Structural component | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| Statistical measures | Of spread and central tendency |
| Representations | Graphs, tables, infographics | 
| Data types | Continuous and discrete; categorical and numerical |

Terms

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| descriptive statistics | describe characteristics of a data set |
| inferential statistics | used to make inferences/guide decisions |
| categorical data | data that can be sorted into groups or categories |
| numerical data | data that can be measured or counted |
| discrete data | data that can only take certain values, typically whole number values |
| continuous data | data that can take any value within a range |
| statistic | A single number that describes a particular property of a data set |

**Averages**

Attempt to represent a common or _typical_ value in a data set.  Three different ways

| Type of average | Description |
| --- | --- |
| mean | Sum of all values divided by the number of values. Sensitive to outliers. |
| median | Middle value when all values are listed in order. Divides a sample in two. **Quartiles** divide a sample in 4.  The lower quartile is the median of the bottom half. |
| mode | Most common value. e.g. most commonly sold product (size of shoe) |

Measures of **dispersion** used to understand the spread/variation.  Most common is the **range**, **interquartile range** (IQR) and **standard deviation**. An **outlier** is a value that is much larger or smaller than the other values in the data set.

**Graphs and tables**

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Frequency table | A frequency table is often used before (or in conjunction with) constructing a table or a graph. |
| --- |  --- |
| Dot plots | A dot plot is a simple method of showing the frequency distribution of discrete numerical data. |
| Picture graph | A picture graph is used to represent the frequency distribution of categorical data. In addition, picture graphs can reinforce the idea of 1-1 correspondence with younger students.  |
| Bar and column graph | Bar and column graphs are used to represent the frequency distributions of categorical data. |
| Pie graph | Pie graphs are a useful way of illustrating part-whole relationships. |
| Histograms | Histograms are used to represent the frequency distribution of continuous numerical data. |
| Line graphs | Line graphs are appropriate when the independent variable is continuous. |
| Scatter graph | A scatter graph shows the relationship between two numerical variables. Scatter graphs can be used with discrete or continuous numerical variables. |
| Stem-and-leaf plot | A stem-and-leaf plot provides a compact visual representation of a data set. Each data value is broken into a stem (usually the first digit of the number) and a leaf (the number's last digit). |
| **Box plot** | Box plots (also known as box and whisker diagrams) provide a visual representation of a data set that shows:  -   the maximum score -   the upper quartile -   the median (not the mean!) -   the lower quartile -   the minimum score. |

#### Statistical Investigation

Process involving posing a question/defining purpose for data collections, acquiring it, organising and displaying to allow for analysis/inferences/conclusions

#### Misunderstandings 

Common misunderstandings in Year 7 to Year 10 statistics can include the following concepts where students may exhibit the reasoning described. 

-   When reading scales and tables of data, students may make assumptions rather than read the provided information.
-   Believing that an average is a typical score that can be calculated in various ways, for example, the mean, mode or median. It is not just the mean.

### Challenges

#### Spurious correlations

Have students investigate a statement that involves an **implied connection between two variables** by collecting and representing data and discuss if the comparison has any correlation 

-   People who own pets that are carnivores (For example: dog/cat) prefer meat lovers pizza.
-   People who live on the north side of the city have more children in their families. 
-   Tall people run faster than short people. 
-   People who exercise more have a higher risk of skin cancer

#### Sports shoe sale challenge

Have students develop a model of what influences secondary students to buy particular shoes. Developing a mathematical model.

The class brainstorms 10 factors and then whittle it down.

### Scaffolding knowledge

Both examples source data from somewhere to then drive student exploration of the data set - secondary data set to explore analysis and display of the data.

- interpret and compare data sets
- interpret and analyse graphs

#### How people use their time (7 & 8)

Comparing real-life data about time use - comparing Australian data to that of other countires

Year 7 - use data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/time-use) [Links to an external site.](https://ourworldindata.org/time-use), students will consider trends in how much time is spent on different categories of time use -- analysing the data 

Pose questions

-   How can you describe the distribution of your data? 
-   What comparisons can you make between the two categories of time usage?  
-   How does Australia compare to the rest of the world?

Year 8 - gather and compare. Students conduct their own survey and compare with data from the ABS- "[How Australians use their time](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/people-and-communities/how-australians-use-their-time/latest-release#four-types-of-time)

Pose questions

#### Rising house costs (9 & 10)

>  As working conditions change with new technology, many occupations no longer need to be working in an office. This has seen a change in population density as many people move out of the capital cities. In this activity, students will collect data on property prices in different regions of New South Wales. They will represent and analyse the data using appropriate methods and draw conclusions based on their research.  

#### Statistics in the media (9 & 10)

> Informed decision-making depends on the ability to evaluate information presented in the media, assess the reasonableness of claims, and identify any biased reporting. In this activity, students will investigate media representations of public opinion around the environmental issue of plastic pollution
