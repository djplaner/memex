title: Statistical Investigation Checklist (CSER)
type: note
---
Items from a checklist provided by CSER. Seems more scaffolded for helping students perform a statistical investigation, rather than learn about evaluating one.  A checklist (or similar "framework") might be useful for scaffolding learning about statistical investigation - [[learning-statistical-investigation-checklist]]

## Year 7 & 8 checklist

### Planning and conducting

- [ ] My statistical investigation focus has been checked with the teacher.
- [ ] At least one question will collect qualitative data.
- [ ] At least one question will collect discrete quantitative data.
- [ ] At least one question will collect continuous quantitative data.
- [ ] I have considered how I will acquire my data.
- [ ] I have considered how I will record and represent my data.
- [ ] I have considered the privacy of the participants' data.

### Displaying and analysing

- [ ] I have identified any outliers in my data and decided whether they should be included or excluded.
- [ ] I can explain how the inclusion of outliers may change my results.
- [ ] I have used appropriate graphical representations for the types of data I have collected.
- [ ] I have calculated relevant measures of centre and spread.
- [ ] I have analysed and interpreted the data I collected.
- [ ] I have communicated the results in the context of my investigation.

## Additional Year 8 checklist

### Planning and conducting

- [ ] I have considered the size needed for my sample.
- [ ] I have considered the ways that bias may impact my sample and made adjustments to minimise the impact.

### Displaying and analysing

- [ ] I have compared different sub-sets of my data and can explain the effect of sample size on the variation of results.
- [ ] I have considered the reliability of my results when making conclusions about the population.
