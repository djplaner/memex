A model for describing what mathematics is and how it develops. This can be used for thinking about teaching mathematics. It emphasises mathematics as

- connected structure;
- a life-describing language; 
- a tool for problem solving;
- leading to a focus on big ideas

Has three tenets (from [YuMi Deadly Maths](https://research.qut.edu.au/ydc/about/yumi-deadly-maths/))

> 1. Mathematics is a cultural and contextual abstraction of reality based on symbols.
> 2. Mathematics reflects back on reality and empowers people to solve problems in their own lives.
> 3. This abstraction and reflection is a creative but also a culturally biased act.

??? note "Goompi model appears a good fit for [[my-approach-to-teaching-mathematics]]"

    Starting with use in the first lessons to abstract out the lessons from the [[number-scabble]] activity. Also linking this later to the mathematical investigation process.
