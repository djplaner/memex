title: Concrete, Representation (Pictorial), Abstract (CRA)
type: note

Three-part instructional framework based on Bruner's theory of representation.

| CRA | Bruner | Classroom  |
| --- | ------ | --- | 
| Concrete | Enactive representation (action-based) | Use tangible objects to solve a math problem |
| Representation | Iconic representation (image-based) | Using images etc to solve a math problem |
| Abstract | Symbolic representation (language-based) | Using only numbers & symbols |

Modelling the concept and providing opportunities to practice is seen as key.

Implementation suggestions include

- 1 lesson for each CRA phase with a final lesson bringing it together
- Four stations around a room with rotation - which seems to break the Bruner sequence, but the point is that it doesn't need to be sequential.
- All in one lesson

Role of the teacher is to make the connections between mathematical concept and the different representations explicit.
