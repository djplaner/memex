## Number Guide

Learning about number includes

- digits and numerals;
- different number systems, structures, processes

### Fundamentals

#### Number types

| Types | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| **Natural numbers** | The set \= {0,1,2,3 ...} or \= {1,2,3 ...} depending on whether counting is started at 0 or 1. The elements of \(N\) are also called the counting numbers, used to count the number of elements in finite sets. |
| **Whole numbers** | The natural numbers including zero, for example, 0, 34 or 1,789. |
| **integer** | An element of the infinite set of numbers \= {...-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3 ...}. |
| **rational number** | Can be expressed as a fraction of two integers where the denominator cannot be 0. It is an element of the infinite set of numbers \(Q = \frac{m}{n}\) where \(m\) and \(n\) are integers and \(n \neq 0\). It may be expressed in decimal form, e.g. \(\frac{1}{8} = 0.125\) and \(\frac{4}{9} = 0.444...\) |  
| **Irrational numbers** | Subset of real numbers that cannot be written in the rational form, for example  |
| **Real numbers** | Collective name for all the rational and irrational numbers |

#### Exponential notation 

| Concept | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| **Exponential** or **index** numbers | A number written in the form \(a^n\) where \(a\) is the base and \(n\) is the index or exponent. |
| **Scientific notation** | A number written in the form \(a \times 10^n\) where \(1 \leq a < 10\) and \(n\) is an integer. |

##### Place value and scientific notation

The decimal system is a positional system using base 10. Large and small numbers can be represented using scientific notation. 

| Name | Number | Scientific notation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Thousandths | 0.001 | 1 x 10<sup>-3</sup> |
| hundreds thousands | 300 000 | 3 x 10<sup>5</sup> |

#### Recurring and terminating decimals 

| Concept | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| **Recurring decimal** | A decimal number with a **pattern of repeating digits** e.g. \(\frac{1}{3} = 0.3333.... = 0.\dot{3}\) or \(\frac{1}{7} = 0.142857142857... = 0.\overline{142857}\) |
| **Terminating decimal** | A decimal number with a **finite number of digits** e.g. \(\frac{1}{2} = 0.5\) or \(\frac{1}{4} = 0.25\) |

#### Rounding 

The rounding rule is to round up if the digit to be rounded is 5 or more, and round down if the digit to be rounded is 4 or less.

#### Operating with numbers

The order of operations typically given using BODMAS or BEDMAS (brackets, orders/exponents, division, multiplication, addition, subtraction). For example

$$\dfrac{2 + (2+2)^2}{2} - 2 \times 2 = 5$$

### Additive thinking

Ability to think and solve problems using repetition (additive) and cumulative strategies. Representing this through models and annotations.

#### Properties of addition

| Property | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| **Identity** | The sum of any number and zero is the number itself. |
| **Commutative** | The order of the numbers does not affect the result. |
| **Associative** | The grouping of the numbers does not affect the result. |
| **Inverse** | The sum of a number and its negative is zero. |

#### Adding and subtracting integers

Provides two models for exploring the properties of positive and negative numbers

| Model | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Counter model | Two types of counters (positive - blue; negative - red) are used to model addition and subtraction of integers. |
| Air balloon model | Puffs of air into/out of a ballon and descent/ascent |

#### Adding and subtracting fractions

- only possible if the denominators are the same
- where different, the fractions need to be converted to equivalent fractions with the same denominator

Finding equivalent fractions can be aided by common [diagrams/models](https://www.turito.com/learn/math/model-additions-of-fractions-grade-4)

| Diagram | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Area model** | A rectangle is divided into equal parts. The fraction is represented by the number of parts shaded. |
| **fraction walls** | |
| **fraction strips** | aka [tape diagrams](https://theothermath.com/index.php/2021/11/02/adding-fractions-with-tape-diagrams-and-area-model/) |
| **line numbers** | |

### Multiplicative thinking

As developing number sense, using a range of additive strategies, build capacity to think multiplicatively

#### Properties of multiplication

| Property | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| **Identity** | The product of any number and one is the number itself. |
| **Commutative** | The order of the numbers does not affect the result. |
| **Associative** | The grouping of the numbers does not affect the result. |
| **distributive** | For all real numbers \(a\), \(b\) and \(c\), \(a \times (b + c) = a \times b + a \times c\) |
| **Inverse** | The product of a number and its reciprocal is one. e.g. \(2 \times \frac{1}{2} = 1\) |

#### Multiplying and dividing integers

- two positive integers results in a positive integer
- two negative integers results in a positive integer
- one positive and one negative integer results in a negative integer

#### Multiplying and dividing fractions

- Multiplying _proper_ fractions results in a smaller answer
- Reading the multiplication of 2 fractions as "of" can help, but also has some issues
- Dividing fractions results in a larger answer

**Financial application of percentages**

- Calculating percentage of quantities done using the rule \( amount = percentage \times quantity \)
- A fraction can be changed into a percentage \(p% = \frac{p}{100}\)
- interest calculation (uses simple interest, doesn't mention complex)

**Proportional comparison**

Use of percentages to compare different quantities

### Proportional reasoning

- A complex process - it is a process of thinking about relationships in multiplicative terms, and identifying and describing what is being compared
- Aided by developing an understanding that quantities have the _same relative size_ or _same ratio_

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| **Ratios** | Variables that have the same unit of measure |
| **Rate** | A ratio between two measurements that have different units (e.g. kmh)

#### Example - mixing paint

Given ratios mixing paint to achieve a shade, the ratio is 3 parts white paint for every 2 parts blue pain. If I have 6 litres of blue paint. How much white paint do I need?"

I have 40 litres of pain. How much white and blue paint would have been used if the ratio was followed?"

#### Proportional reasoning strategies

e.g. 

- comparision involving rates - which is faster 100km/hr or 6 m/min?
- missing value problems: A box of fruit has 3 apples for every 4 oranges. How many apples are needed if there are 36 oranges?

These can be difficult - then language. Supporting strategies

- using materials/diagrams to model the situation 
- Using [[newmans-error-analysis]] to find where students struggle.

### Misunderstandings

aka [[mathematical-misconceptions]] arising from 

- a learner misinterpreting the original intent/idea
- used a "helpful" rule without understanding the implications of using in a new context

Common misconceptions in Number

- multiplication
  - Multiplication always results in a larger number 
- division 
  - Division is commutative like multiplication 
  - You can divide smaller numbers into larger numbers regardless of order e.g. \(5 \div 10 = 2\) 
  - ?? what about division resulting in smaller numbers ??
- exponentials 
  - exponents are the same as multiplying 
  - a negative exponent implies the number is negative
- fractions
  - Confusion about place value e.g. 7 hundredths is \(0.700\) and not \(0.07\) 
  - The decimal point separates two whole numbers e.g. \(15.67\) should not be read as fifteen point 67.
  - Not recognising the size of a decimal number e.g. thinking \(1.25 > 1.3\)
  - Thinking that multiplying by 10 always adds a zero
  - thinking that numerator and denominator are whole numbers and thus thinking they can add/subject each part individually
  - confusion over relationship between fractions and decimals e.g. \(\frac{1}{10} = 0.1\) so \(\frac{1}{8} = 0.08\)
  - thinking that mixed numbers will always be bigger e.g. \(1 \frac{1}{2} > \frac{15}{5}\)

### Digital technology tools

- [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/scientific) - scientific calculator
- [Partial product finder](https://apps.mathlearningcenter.org/partial-product-finder/) - enter a simple multiplication which is represented as a rectangle and then can be interacted with to reveal partial products - ways to calculate partial products 
- Geogebra - mentioned as having many tools - e.g. [ratios](https://www.geogebra.org/m/knxczufb#chapter/471682)
- [TIMES modules](https://schools.amsi.org.au/times-modules/) from AMSI

## Challenges

i.e. puzzles, problems, interesting ideas in mathematics etc.  Seen as effective ways to engage students and check understanding across strands.

### [Fermi problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_problem) - estimation

aka order-of-magntiude problem. Challenging to answer exactly.   Aim is to break down the problem into smaller steps. For example

- How many people in the world are on their mobile phones right now?
- How many jelly beans fit a bucket?
- Could you fit $1M worth of $1 coins in your classroom?

No right or wrong way.

#### Pose questions

-   What is your initial thought about the problem? Will the answer be a large number or a small number? 
-   How could you begin to work on this problem? What do you know, or what could you find out? 
-   Can you think of a way to simplify or downsize the problem to be something you can manage to get an idea about the problem?

### Flag fractions

Use country flags that echo area models that can be used to calculate fractions.

e.g. French flag shows thirds. Columbian, Thai.

##### Pose question

-   What could a flag that is half green and half gold look like? 
-   How many different flags could we make as a class? Could everyone design a half-and-half flag that is different (not different colours but shows the halves in different ways)
