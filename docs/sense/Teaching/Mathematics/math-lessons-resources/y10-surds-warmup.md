Prepare a warmup activity for a Year 10 surge class. Focus on simplifying surds. Part of a sequence of lessons revising for an imminent final exam.

## Aim

Be able to answer questions that ask

> Simplify the following expressions. Write your answers in the simplest exact surd form.

For example

1. $$3\sqrt(27) =$ -- _take out any obvious square factors_

    - $= 3 \times ( \sqrt(9) \times \sqrt(3) )$
    - $= 3 \times 3 \times \sqrt(3)$
    - $= 9\sqrt(3)$

1. $7\sqrt(2) + 3\sqrt(8) =$ -- take out any obvious square factors, addition of like squares

    - $7\sqrt(2) + 3(\sqrt(4 \times 2)) =$
    - $7\sqrt(2) + 3(\sqrt(4) \times \sqrt(2)) =$
    - $7\sqrt(2) + 3 \times 2 \times \sqrt(2) =$
    - $7\sqrt(2) + 6\sqrt(2) =$
    - $13\sqrt(2)$

1. $-6\sqrt(3) + 5\sqrt(12) =$
1. $\dfrac{\sqrt(35)}{\sqrt(7)} =$ 

## Design considerations

### Motivation

- Approximation is bad
- Some connection with trignometic ratios
- _rationalising the denominator_ arises elsewhere: algebra, calculus, and later mathematics

### Necessary knowledge

- Declarative knowledge

  - What are [[surds]]

      - What is a _like surd_ and _unlike surd_
      - What is a _conjugate surd_

  - What does _simplify_ mean?
  - What does _simplest exact surd form_ mean?
  - Distributive law and special products

      - Distributive law will be helpful

          - $a(b + c) = ab + ac$
          - $a(b - c) = ab - ac$
          - $(a + b)(c + d) = ac + ad + bc + bd$ 
      - The _difference of squares_ identity is very useful for simplifying surds

          - $a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)$



  - Basic rules

    - For positive numbers, squaring and taking a square root are _inverse processes_

        - $(\sqrt(a))^2 = a$
        - $\sqrt(a^2) = a$

    - Multiplication

        - $\sqrt(a) \times \sqrt(b) = \sqrt(ab)$
        - $a\sqrt(b) \times c\sqrt(d) = ac\sqrt(bd)$

    - Division 

        - $\sqrt(a) \div \sqrt(b) = \sqrt(a/b)$
        - $a\sqrt(b) \div c\sqrt(d) = \dfrac{a}{c}\sqrt(b/d)$

    - Addition and subtraction of like surds
        - $a\sqrt(b) \pm c\sqrt(b) = (a \pm c)\sqrt(b)$


- Procedural knowledge

    - Which one or more of the 

## Implementation

### Mathematics is patterns and relationships

- Some idea to reinforce this point - perhaps on the slide with the warm up activity

    - The [_Golden Ratio_](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/nature-golden-ratio-fibonacci.html) is one of the earliest and most famous surds discovered by the Greeks (and perhaps others?)

- Related to surds, algebra, or logs/exponentials in someway
- Maybe a step too far

Questions

1. $\sqrt(32)$ - as a simple application of taking out any square factors (probably not)
2. $5\sqrt(12)$ - take out square factors + multiplication
3. $8\sqrt(5) + 3\sqrt(20)$ - take out square factors + addition of like surds
4. $-3\sqrt(3) + 2\sqrt(27)$ - take out square factors + addition of like surds
5. $\dfrac{\sqrt(63)}{\sqrt(7)}$ 
6. $\dfrac{\sqrt(5) - 3}{\sqrt(3) + 1}$
