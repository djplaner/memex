# Real work versus Real world

See also: [[teaching-mathematics]], [[when-will-i-ever-use-mathematics]]

Dan Meyer [makes the distinction between real work v real world](https://blog.mrmeyer.com/2014/developing-the-question-real-work-v-real-world/). The idea being that how much real world (e.g. adding mobile phones to a problem) is only one dimension. Another is the reality/interestingness of the work students do. Meyer suggests problem formulation and question development as being more "real" types of work.
