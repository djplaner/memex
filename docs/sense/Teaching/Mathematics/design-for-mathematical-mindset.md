Nascent set of ideas about how to go about designing interventions that support the development of a [[mathematical-mindset]]


## Learning theories and growth mindset

Campbell et al (2020) map 6 behaviours of a [[growth-mindset]] against four learning theories to provide guidance on what learning interventions should do/avoid to encourage a growth mindset (part of a mathematical mindset).  The following provides a summary of their table.

### Challenges

A growth mindset actively looks for _challenges_ that will help them improve. A fixed mindset avoids challenges that might expose weaknesses.

Behaviourism (success follows observation of an expert on similar problems)

- Reward level linked to challenge level
- Minimal penalty for mistakes
- Multiple attempts and self-pacing
- Avoid strong negative feedback

Constructivism
 
- Use wide selection of resources, low floor, high ceiling
- Model and reward value of questions when stuck
- Ask students to set challenging problems
- Balance amount of feedback to all students

CoP

- Have experts explain how they've dealt with and benefited from failure/challenge
- Key CoP members remember their failures/challenges and model how to deal with challenge

Connectivism

- Provide resources that include more complex problems, explain common mistakes, and use a variety of problem solving methods
- Model help-seeking behaviour as a way of learning (not a sign of weakness)
- Ensure students are able to find and make sense of information resources

### Persistence

A growth mindset continues to persist with difficulties, understanding they can succeed through continuing to work hard and different ways of working. 

Behaviourism

- Feedback on low achievement should emphasise the possiblity of improvement
- Suggest alternative strategies and allow repeated attempts
- No public display of low achievement

Constructivism

- Activities operate in ZPD
- Link to pre-requisite content
- Give partial credit

CoP 

- Share community member stories of persistence, preferably members compatible with individuals

Connectivism 

- pair low-achievement feedback with alternative resources
- Mitigate situations where there is a predominance of low-achieving members (avoid normalisation)
