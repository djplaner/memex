# Design for a mathematical mindset



Nascent set of ideas about how to go about designing interventions that support the development of a [[mathematical-mindset]]


## Learning theories and growth mindset

Campbell et al (2020) map 6 behaviours of a [[growth-mindset]] against four learning theories to provide guidance on what learning interventions should do/avoid to encourage a growth mindset (part of a mathematical mindset).  The following provides a summary of their table.

### Challenges

A growth mindset actively looks for _challenges_ that will help them improve. A fixed mindset avoids challenges that might expose weaknesses.

Behaviourism (success follows observation of an expert on similar problems)

- Reward level linked to challenge level
- Minimal penalty for mistakes
- Multiple attempts and self-pacing
- Avoid strong negative feedback

Constructivism
 
- Use wide selection of resources, low floor, high ceiling
- Model and reward value of questions when stuck
- Ask students to set challenging problems
- Balance amount of feedback to all students

CoP

- Have experts explain how they've dealt with and benefited from failure/challenge
- Key CoP members remember their failures/challenges and model how to deal with challenge

Connectivism

- Provide resources that include more complex problems, explain common mistakes, and use a variety of problem solving methods
- Model help-seeking behaviour as a way of learning (not a sign of weakness)
- Ensure students are able to find and make sense of information resources

### Persistence

A growth mindset continues to persist with difficulties, understanding they can succeed through continuing to work hard and different ways of working. 

Behaviourism

- Feedback on low achievement should emphasise the possiblity of improvement
- Suggest alternative strategies and allow repeated attempts
- No public display of low achievement

Constructivism

- Activities operate in ZPD
- Link to pre-requisite content
- Give partial credit

CoP 

- Share community member stories of persistence, preferably members compatible with individuals

Connectivism 

- pair low-achievement feedback with alternative resources
- Mitigate situations where there is a predominance of low-achieving members (avoid normalisation)

### Effort

Growth mindset understands learning is hardwork, not a sign of failure (needing to do more, longer)

Behaviourism

- Encourage and reward repeated attempts that integrate feedback to change
- Make public the benefits of time on task to improvement
- Provide differentiated activities to engage all
- Minimise comparisons with peers who achieve with little effort
- Avoid teaching practices (e.g. reuse of past test questions) that reward low effort rote learning

Constructivism

- Use rubrics listing sub-steps of expert behaviour, including optoinal steps
- Ask learners to rate how much effort a task required
- Include extension options on assignments
- Avoid distant deadlines without interim deadlines
- Avoid using a single type of assessment

CoP

- Members share stories of a variety of effortful practices used
- Share stories how habit development helps learning become less effortful as expertise is generated

Connectivism 

- set tasks requiring a variety of resources and multiple steps
- Encourage self-reflection
- Assignment tasks comparing solutions from different sources
- Avoid the effort gathering and using resources receiving the credit without student learning

### Praise

Growth mindset favours praise for effort, not for the individual.

Behaviourism

- Praise successful completion, rather than achievement
- Avoid praising effort that did not lead to success
- Avoid pubic praise to high achievers

Constructivism

- Praise efforts to overcome obstacles
- Avoid praise for level achievement (rather than the work)

CoP

- praise when students ask for help
- showcase different styles of high quality work
- avoid highly praised celebrity-status community members

Connectivism

- Praise sourcing notes and examples
- Avoid reliance on single best resources

## Success

Success of others is an inspiration, not threatening

Behaviourism

- Set tasks observing of feedback from failure being used to achieve success
- Reward referring to the work of others

Constructivism

- Peer tutoring from a more advanced peer
- Value different ways of constructing knowledge

CoP 

- Showcase diverse examples of success from others
- Avoid limiting the quantity of individuals achieving the highest level of success

Connectivism

- Make it easier to engage in collaborative solving of mathematical problems - sharing ideas
- Have students source, rate and comment on popular YouTube videos
- Minimise adverse network effects from prevalence of high success individuals

## Learning goals

Growth mindset sees learning as a process of improving performance, not a showcase of performance.

Behaviourism 

- Feedback in form of written comments, not grades
- Record grades but only release after students have engaged with feedback and made corrections/completed post-test etc
- Avoid public/competitive results

Constructivism

- Provide opportunities to demonstrate learning from mistakes e.g. After receiving feedback, students make corrections and resubmit with notes on how they will avoid similar errors

Connectivism

- Create voluntary tutoring groups where past students engage with current
