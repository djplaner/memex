Program of pedagogical strategies based on sociological research by Cohen and colleagues. Aiming to increase participation and learning for all.

Cited by Boaler (see [[mathematical-mindsets]]) which may well be an outgrowth/influenced by Complex Instruction.

## Principles

1. Multiple ability curriculum - open-ended, rich tasks to support learning of key concept and skills.
2. Instructional strategies - norms, roles and teacher interventions to develop autonomy and interdependence
3. Status and accountability - raise expectations, hold individuals and groups accountable for learning, intervening in status issues
    Linked to "expectation states theory" - status characteristics affect interaction and influence group situations. Rate of interaction in a group is a predictor of learning. Low status can limit interaction. Addressed through

    - multiple-abilities treatment - make visible to all the different types of "intelligence" required for the task:

      - naming the different abilities required
      - create a mixed set of expectations for each student - they are strong/weak on different skills

    - Assigning competence to low-status students
      - Public statement recognising competence of individuals
      - positive evaluation


## Methods

### Random assignment of groups and roles

Group roles and allocations are done randomly e.g. [[visibly-random-groups]].  Every few weeks students change groups and roles. Teacher emphasises different roles during classes and reminding facilitators

### Roles

| Role |  Description |
| ---- |  ----------- |
| Facilitator | Ensure all group reads the problem. Keep group together. Ensure all are heard. Prompt contributions (different ways of seeing, ready to move on). Ensure everyone can explain. |
| Recorder/Reporter | Ensure group organises results including showing ideas from all, multiple representations. Also need to be ready to join the teacher for a huddle. |
| Resource Manager | Get materials for the team. Make sure all questions are team questions. Call the teacher when done (and perhaps for questions).  |
| Team Captain | Remind the team to find reasons for each mathematical statement, search for connections. Not talking outside group |

| Role | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| Organiser | Keep the group together and focused on the problem, no talking outside the group |
| Resourcer | Only person that can get resources, make sure everyone is ready before you call the teacher |
| Understander | Make sure all ideas are explained for understanding for all in group; encourage idea generators to explain if any don't; write down important parts of explanations |
| Includer | Make sure everyone's ideas are listened to; invite other people to make suggestions |


## Group Tasks for Complex Instruction

Summarised from (Cohen et al, 1999)

- foster conceptual understanding group activities are organised around a central concept/big idea
- students encounter the concept in different contexts, multiple opportunities
- tasks are inherently uncertain and open-ended in terms of solution and process
- tasks require multiple different types of abilities to allow students' diverse capabilities to shine
