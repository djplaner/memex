Questions with multiple responses

- What mathematics do you see? 

    Images can open up different responses.  But a point seems to be to have scaffolding questions ready.

- Compare and contrast two different representations?

    Or offer different answers to a problem. Some with carefully chosen misconceptions etc.

- Questions that generate debate

    How many times would you shake hands if everyone shook hands with everyone? Smallest/largest prime number?

Use TPS or similar to get around contribution fear. Create a culture.
