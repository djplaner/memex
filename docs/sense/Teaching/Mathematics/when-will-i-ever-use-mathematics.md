# When will I ever use mathematics

See also: [[teaching-mathematics]]

## Why is it asked?

- Struggling with current specific mathematics - as suggested by Mason (see below)

## Methods for answering

- Show how it is used.

    e.g. the explicit examples given by sites below

- "Lifting weights for the brain"

    e.g. [redit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/7u5uat/math_teachers_when_students_inevitably_ask_when/dthtqxs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) in that mathematics helps improve mental ability and problem solving skills - though with the caveat that how mathematics is taught can be problematic with overemphasis on memorisation or problem solving as algorithmic. Another [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/7u5uat/math_teachers_when_students_inevitably_ask_when/dtipbyz/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) links more explicitly to drills in sports (e.g. ladder drills in soccer practice)

        [Another](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/7u5uat/math_teachers_when_students_inevitably_ask_when/dti6e89/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) links it to employers wanting hires with "skills in numeracy, problem solving, abstract thinking and following complicated procedures and instructions"

- Forget extrinsic value, it has intrinsic value

    e.g. [redit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/7u5uat/math_teachers_when_students_inevitably_ask_when/dthvr02/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) - quoting math teacher 'I don't care, we're going to learn it because I think it's fun"

- What are you struggling with?

    [John Mason describes](https://educationblog.oup.com/secondary/maths/why-are-we-doing-this-miss) his experience suggesting that students ask this question when they are struggling with whatever mathematics they are currently doing. Suggesting that a useful response might be to questioning them to find out what they are struggling with and then addressing that.
