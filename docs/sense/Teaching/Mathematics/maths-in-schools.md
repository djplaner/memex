## Misc comments

Implemented as a Canvas course. With a single long page as home page, including

- image map to main modules and "community hive" (discussion forum)
- a _getting around_ section that seems to duplicate some of that
- Modules appear to be Design Plus designs.
- Using the h5p video element for intro video
