# Enactive mathematics pedagogy



Linked to [Jerome Bruner's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Bruner#Developmental_psychology) elaboration of _enactive_ (action-based), _iconic_ (image-based), and _symbolic_ (language-based) modes of representation (of tasks). Not clearly delineated, only loosely sequential since they can be translated into each other. However, moving from enactive > iconic > symbolic can be better for learning.

## Effective use of manipulatives


Henderson et al (2020) offer the following

- Ensure there is a clear rationale

    The main rationale they provide is "used to provide insights into increasingly sophisticated maths"

    ??? note "More useful advice would be welcome"

        Why not identify the situations/reasons why manipulatives are required, when they provide advantage?

- Enable students to understand the links between manipulatives and the mathematical ideas they represent

- Try to avoid students becoming reliant on manipulatives

    i.e. manipulatives are used to help students understand the mathematical ideas, but not to solve problems.

- Manipulatives should act as 'scaffold', which can be removed

    ??? bug "Is this true with all manipulatives/scaffolding"

        This seems to clash with Boaler's advice about using hands/fingers to count. i.e. if it is useful, why not use it? 

        How does this apply to calculators and other "technologies" which people use to solve matheamtical problems? How would [[mathematical-problem-solving#Wolfram TED Talk (2010)|Conrad Wolfram]] respond to this?

- Manipulatives can be used to support students of all ages

They also suggest that evidence for number lines is strong, but evidence is weaker for other representations. (Five relevant meta-analyses support concrete manipulatives, two systematic reviews support visual representations)
