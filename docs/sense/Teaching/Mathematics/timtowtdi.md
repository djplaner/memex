Originally became aware of [TIMTOWTDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIMTOWTDI) as a [Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl#Philosophy) programmer in the 1990s. But appears to apply to [[teaching-mathematics]] as the ability to represent mathematical concepts (and problems) in multiple different ways is useful and a key aspect of mathematics.
