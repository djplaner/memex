## The problem

Students are asked to solve the following list of related multiplication problems.  Richland et al (2012) found that students didn't make any connections between the individual problems to help them arrive at solutions.

1. $10 \times 3 =$
2. $10 \times 13 =$
3. $20 \times 13 =$
4. $30 \times 13 =$
5. $31 \times 13 =$
6. $29 \times 13 =$
7. $22 \times 13 =$
