Sourced from an example given in Lee & Yeo (2022) written as

> Martin was making play dough. He added 3/4 cup of flour to the bowl. Then he added another 3/6 cup. Is the total amount he used greater than or less than 1 cup? How much flour did he use?

## Implementation ideas

- Reframe it for an older age group
- Use teaching cooking pizza as an example
- Frame it in the form of [[three-acts-of-a-mathematical-story]]?
