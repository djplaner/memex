# Mathematical structure

See also: [[teaching-mathematics]]

Nascent idea about the importance of understanding mathematical structures to being able to teach it effectively.

Watson & Shipman (2008) cite Davis and Hersh (1980) arguing that _mathematical structure_ is manifested "through relationships among variance/invariance and similarity/difference". By understanding/identifying those relationship we begin to

- define classes of mathematical objects - which can be something physical, a symoblic representation, an abstract idea (classification or relationship)
- understand the effects of operations
- express and manipulate relationships
- etc
