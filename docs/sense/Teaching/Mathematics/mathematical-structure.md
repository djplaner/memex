title: Mathematical structure
---
Nascent idea about the importance of understanding mathematical structures to being able to teach it effectively. But begs the question which mathematical structure? There's probably not one?

## Watson & Shipman - learner generated examples

Watson & Shipman (2008) cite Davis and Hersh (1980) arguing that _mathematical structure_ is manifested "through relationships among variance/invariance and similarity/difference". By understanding/identifying those relationship we begin to

- define classes of mathematical objects - which can be something physical, a symbolic representation, an abstract idea (classification or relationship)
- understand the effects of operations
- express and manipulate relationships
- etc

## In teaching/learning

US-based common core standards identified _avenues for mathematical thinking_ ([see this](https://www.fosteringmathpractices.com/avenues-of-thinking/))

- Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them

    The core of the mathematical practice, engagement in which can include...
- Reason abstractly and quantitatively - quantities and relationships
- Look for and make use of structure - organisation or behaviour of number and space
- Look for and express regularity and repeated reasoning - repetition in processes or calculations

## CSER MOOC

CSER [[maths-in-schools]] MOOC offers the following "common structures"

-   number systems
    -   decimal system (base 10) using the digits 0 to 9
    -   natural numbers
    -   negative numbers
    -   binary system (base 2) using only the digits 0 and 1 and used for programming
    -   Roman numerals
-   language conventions
-   algebraic rule
    -   pronumerals and variables
    -   expressions and equations
-   measures
    -   length
    -   unit
    -   scale
-   symbolic representation
    -   less than \(<\) and and more than \(>\)
    - \(\div \times = \)

-   spatial operations
    -   associative and commutative properties
