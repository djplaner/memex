# Mathematical structure

See also: [[teaching-mathematics]]

Nascent idea about the importance of understanding mathematical structures to being able to teach it effectively.

Watson & Shipman (2008) cite Davis and Hersh (1980) arguing that _mathematical structure_ is manifested "through relationships among variance/invariance and similarity/difference". By understanding/identifying those relationship we begin to

- define classes of mathematical objects - which can be something physical, a symbolic representation, an abstract idea (classification or relationship)
- understand the effects of operations
- express and manipulate relationships
- etc

## In teaching/learning

US-based common core standards identified _avenues for mathematical thinking_ ([see this](https://www.fosteringmathpractices.com/avenues-of-thinking/))

- Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them

    The core of the mathematical practice, engagement in which can include...
- Reason abstractly and quantitatively - quantities and relationships
- Look for and make use of structure - organisation or behaviour of number and space
- Look for and express regularity and repeated reasoning - repetition in processes or calculations
