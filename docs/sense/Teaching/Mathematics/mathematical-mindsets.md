Following are rough notes from reading 

Boaler, J. (2015). Mathematical Mindsets: Unleashing Studentsâ€™ Potential Through Creative Math, Inspiring Messages and Innovative Teaching. John Wiley & Sons, Incorporated.

> this books is about the creation of _mathematical mindsets_ through a new kind of teaching and parenting that is, at its heart, about growth, innovation, creativity, and the fulfillment of mathematics potential.

## Chapter list

1. The brain and mathematics learning
2. The power of mistakes and struggle

    - Find ways to celebrate mistakes
    - Highlight/value conceptual mistakes, rather than numerical errors
    - Abandon testing and grading as much as possible - being marked down for mistakes has consequences
3. The creativity and beauty of mathematics

    - What do students see as their role in a mathematics class?
        - Mostly it's a solver of problems.  Rather than being there to appreciate the beauty of maths, ask deep questions, explore rich connections, learn about the applicability of the subject.
4. Creating mathematical mindsets: The importance of flexibility with numbers

    - Repetitive and simple ideas (common mathematical teaching approach) fail to move students into disequilibrium - part of learning
5. Rich Mathematical Tasks

    Provides numerous examples and then moves onto offering 6 questions to ask about a mathematics learning task that will help transform them into [[rich-mathematical-tasks]]
6. Mathematics and the path to equity

    - Mathematics (in the US) has the largest achievement differences due to ethnicity, gender and socio-economic levels.
    - Argues that the push for mathematics as a "performance subject" and an elitist take
    - A view that reinforces the fixed mindset view (you are good at math or not) rather than growth (valuing effort and learning)
    - Choices about who proceeds into "higher" math in high school also influences outcomes, and in turn is influenced by perceptions of "good" students (no disciplin problems, homework in on time)
    - Parents equating "procedural skill" with capability, but ignoring conceptual understanding and problem solving
    - Need to move mathematics from an "elitist, performance subject used to rank and sort students (and teachers) to an open, learning subject"
    - Equitable strategies
        - Offer all students high-level content
        - Work to change ideas about who can achieve in mathematics
        - Encourage students to think deeply about mathematics

            Makes the case for mathematics as a "connected, inquiry-based subject" for addressing inequalities and increasing achievement.
        - Teach student to work together

            Research showing that working on mathematics collaboratively helps to make connections etc.
        - Give girls and students of color additional encouragement to learn math and science 
    - Eliminate (or at least change the nature of) homework

        - PISA (2015) found "homework perpetuates inequalities in education"
        - Numerous other issues
7. From tracking to growth mindset grouping

    - "Opportunity to learn" key factor in student achievement
    - more access to high-level mathematics means higher achievement
    - tracking seen as greatest reinforcement of fixed mindsets
    - tracking can be seen as being helpful for teachers in being able to deliver learning experiences at the right level, but this argument ignores the fact that even in similarly tracked classes there is a wide range of abilities/needs
    - Focus of this chapter is on modern/effective forms of grouping
    - Growth mindset grouping - i.e. basically heterogenous grouping
    - Teaching heterogeneous groups effectively: the mathematics tasks

        "It is not enough to de-track and then teach through narrow mathematics questions that will be accessible to only a few students"
        - Providing open-ended tasks - i.e. [[low-floor-high-ceiling-wide-walls#Mathematics]] 

            Point is made that the teacher will engage in explicit teaching, but in response to student working through of the open-ended task. Echoing Fry and Hillman (2018)

        - Offering a choice of tasks

            Where task explained as "going to different places", rather than easy/difficult.

        - Individualised pathways

            Mentions the [[SMILE]] cards from the UK.

8. Assessment for a growth mindset
9. Teaching mathematics for a growth mindset

### Teaching and impact

- Cohen & Garcia (2014) - 1 experience/message can change everything for students
- Beilock, Gunderson, Ramirez & Levine (2009) - primary school teachers' negative emotions on math predict achievements of girls in their classes, not boys
- Silver (1994) - give students opportunities to pose mathematical problems, to consider a situation and think of mathematical questions to ask - the essence of real math - they become more engaged and perform at a higher level
- Boaler (2015a) - What's math got to do with it - describes a classroom approach based on posing mathematical questions
- Schwartz & Bransford (1998) - comparison of three ways of teaching mathematics - related to [[productive-failure]]
- Wang, 1998; Elmore & Fuhrman, 1995 - OTL most important condition for learning

- Good, Rattan & Dweck (2012) - studetns sense of belonging in math

### Value of mathematics

- Rose & Betts (2004) and Boaler (2005) - more math classes == higher earnings 10 years later - as much as 19.5%
- In the US the high school maths courses done from year 9 influence what people do for the rest of their life, is this the case in Australia?

### What is mathematics

- Devlin (1997) - mathematicians describe math as "the study of patterns; that it is an aesthetic, creative, and beautiful subject"
- Devlin (2006) - mathematics used by animals, and humans as natural mathematics users
- Reuben Hersh (1999) - What is mathematics, really?
