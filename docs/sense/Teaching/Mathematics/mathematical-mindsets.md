# Mathematical mindsets

See also: [[mathematical-mindset]]

Following are rough notes from reading 

Boaler, J. (2015). Mathematical Mindsets: Unleashing Studentsâ€™ Potential Through Creative Math, Inspiring Messages and Innovative Teaching. John Wiley & Sons, Incorporated.

> this books is about the creation of _mathematical mindsets_ through a new kind of teaching and parenting that is, at its heart, about growth, innovation, creativity, and the fulfillment of mathematics potential.

## Chapter list

1. The brain and mathematics learning
2. The power of mistakes and struggle

    - Find ways to celebrate mistakes
    - Highlight/value conceptual mistakes, rather than numerical errors
    - Abandon testing and grading as much as possible - being marked down for mistakes has consequences
3. The creativity and beauty of mathematics

    - What do students see as their role in a mathematics class?
        - Mostly it's a solver of problems.  Rather than being there to appreciate the beauty of maths, ask deep questions, explore rich connections, learn about the applicability of the subject.
4. Creating mathematical mindsets: The importance of flexibility with numbers

    - Repetitive and simple ideas (common mathematical teaching approach) fail to move students into disequilibrium - part of learning
5. Rich Mathematical Tasks

    Provides numerous examples and then moves onto offering 6 questions to ask about a mathematics learning task that will help transform them into [[rich-mathematical-tasks]]
6. Mathematics and the path to equity
7. From tracking to growth mindset grouping
8. Assessment for a growth mindset
9. Teaching mathematics for a growth mindset

### Teaching and impact

- Cohen & Garcia (2014) - 1 experience/message can change everything for students
- Beilock, Gunderson, Ramirez & Levine (2009) - primary school teachers' negative emotions on math predict achievements of girls in their classes, not boys
- Silver (1994) - give students opportunities to pose mathematical problems, to consider a situation and think of mathematical questions to ask - the essence of real math - they become more engaged and perform at a higher level
- Boaler (2015a) - What's math got to do with it - describes a classroom approach based on posing mathematical questions
- Schwartz & Bransford (1998) - comparison of three ways of teaching mathematics - related to [[productive-failure]]

### Value of mathematics

- Rose & Betts (2004) and Boaler (2005) - more math classes == higher earnings 10 years later - as much as 19.5%

### What is mathematics

- Devlin (1997) - mathematicians describe math as "the study of patterns; that it is an aesthetic, creative, and beautiful subject"
- Devlin (2006) - mathematics used by animals, and humans as natural mathematics users
- Reuben Hersh (1999) - What is mathematics, really?
