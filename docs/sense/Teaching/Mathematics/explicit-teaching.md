Aims to minimise cognitive load and its ramifications (e.g. misinterpretations) by presenting carefully planned sequences of instruction to suit the learning outcomes.

_Explicit teaching_ is seen (by some) as an umbrella term covering different models, including:

- explicit instruction.
- explicit direct instruction.
- direct instruction.
- I do, we do, you do.

## Practices

Specific practices likely influence more by the particular model.

[[cser-practices-and-pedagogies|CSER MOOC]] suggests _explicit teaching_ requires the teacher to 

- decide on learning intentions and success criteria and make them transparent to students;
- provide instruction/demonstration by modelling, including worked examples;
- demonstrate mathematical thinking and reasoning;
- check for understanding;
- provide students with opportunities to practice and demonstrate and receive feedback

Archer and Hughes identify 6 teaching functions of explicit instruction

1. Review of previous learning

    - Review relevant previous learning 
    - Review pre-requisite K&S

2. Presentation of new learning 

    - State lesson goals 
    - Present new material in small steps 
    - Model procedures 
    - Provide examples and non-examples 
    - Use clear language 
    - Avoid digressions from the learning

3. Guided practice

    - Engage with students to get a high frequency of responses 
    - Provide multiple opportunities for students to succeed by supporting their learning 
    - Provide timely feedback, cues and prompts to help focus students on how to improve and master the skill 
    - Have multiple opportunities for students to practice until they are fluent

4. Corrections and feedback

    - User formative assessment to identify when necessary to reteach and review

5. Independent practice

    - Monitor initial practice attempts
    - Have students continue practice until skills are automatic

6. Ongoing review of learning - back to 1

## Definition

First explicit definition shown
> A way to teach in a direct, structured way.

Essential components (explicit teaching)

- Dialogue 
- Questioning
- Modelling 
- Learning Needs 
- Planning
- Connections
- Feedback

Core components of [explicit instruction](https://www.thescienceofmath.com/misconceptions-inquiry-based-versus-explicit-instruction)

- segmenting complex skills into manageable concepts
- emphasizing critical concepts through modeling and think alouds
- systematically fading supports to promote independence
- providing opportunities for students response and feedback
- providing purposeful practice opportunities for students

## Claims

Explicit teaching used as a way to develop

- inclusive practices,
- student agency,
- mathematical dialogue,
- regular feedback,
- cognitive activation (strategies)

## Misconceptions

Argues that explicit teaching can use multiple pedagogical approaches with the goal of improving quality of learning. Not just passive or rote learning, systematic instruction. The broad focus, however, is to

- present the learning intention to students;
- told how they will be learning it;
- given criteria for success.

Quite a few examples in the first activity focus on students engaging in practical tasks.
