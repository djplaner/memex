Essential components

- Dialogue 
- Questioning
- Modelling 
- Learning Needs 
- Planning
- Connections
- Feedback

## Claims

Explicit teaching used as a way to develop

- inclusive practices,
- student agency,
- mathematical dialogue,
- regular feedback,
- cognitive activation (strategies)

## Misconceptions

Argues that explicit teaching can use multiple pedagogical approaches with the goal of improving quality of learning. Not just passive or rote learning, systematic instruction. The broad focus, however, is to

- present the learning intention to students;
- told how they will be learning it;
- given criteria for success.

Quite a few examples in the first activity focus on students engaging in practical tasks.
