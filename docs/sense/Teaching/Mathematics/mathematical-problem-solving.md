title: Mathematical problem solving
---
A collection of insights/perspectives on problem solving in mathematics - particularly related pedagogies.

There does appear to be a tendency for these problem solving models to be represented as sequential steps. i.e. mini waterfall methods where one step is completed before the next is started - the [world (and what we do it it) isn't that sequential](https://djon.es/blog/2016/09/11/which-comes-first-pedagogy-or-technology/) - see [[pedagogy-before-technology]]. A perspective which echoes with a comment Boaler makes about mathematicians doing a lot of "playing with mathematics" as they try to solve a problem.


## [Wolfram TED Talk (2010)](https://www.ted.com/talks/conrad_wolfram_teaching_kids_real_math_with_computers/transcript)

Four stage process for working on mathematics

1. Posing a question
2. Going from the real world to a mathematical model
3. Performing a calculation
4. Going from the model back to the real world, to see if the original question was answered

Wolfram argues that 80% of school mathematics is spent on stage 3.

## Australian curriculum [[maths-in-schools]]

Offers the following diagram which aims to represent what the [[v9-oz-mathematics-learning-area]] offers as a mathematics modelling process using "mathematics to formulate, analyse, solve, interpret, generalise and communicate their results in response to a real-world situation"

The image offers the following process

1. Identify | describe

    - _Interpret_ a situation and _identify_ a contextualised problem
    - _Describe_ the problem _mathematically_

2. PLan

    - _Break_ the problem into _smaller parts_
    - _Identify_ and _formulate_ the _maths_ required

3. Apply | do

    - _Apply_ appropriate _maths strategies_ to create a solution.
    - Develop a _series of steps_ to _solve_ the problem _using_ maths.
    - Model the solution - create a mathematical _representation_ of the proposed _solution_

4. Communicate

    - _Share and explain_ the solution in terms of the context.
    
5. Consider

    - _Consider and evaluate_ - check the solution makes sense against the original context or scenario
    - _Adapt_ solution and apply changes if needed
