Acting head of of prices statistics at the ABS (Leigh Merrington) offers this description

> when a product's "quantity (or volume) falls but the price remains the same"

Misc other quotes

> "Shrinkflation is common in snacks and confectionary, like chocolate and chips, as well as in breakfast cereals, biscuits, spreads, like jam, and non-food items, such as shampoo and cleaning products," Merrington says

> Shrinkflation has become more prevalent over the past couple of years, however we don't have statistics available to say by how much," Merrington says.

## Mathematical applications

- Calculating 

### Percentages

[ABS article](https://www.abs.gov.au/articles/quality-change-australian-cpi) demonstrates using the notion of _observed_ and _adjusted price_ to track the impact of quality changes on the CPI. Following table demonstrates for soft drink

| | Period 1 | Period 2 | Period 3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Volume | 750ml | 750ml | 675ml |
| Observed price | $3.00 | $3.00 | $3.00 |
| Adjusted price | $3.00 | $3.00 | $3.30 |
| Observed movement |  | 0.0% | 0.0% |
| Adjusted movement |  | 0.0% | 10.0% |
