Suggested starter "What are three things you would really like your child to accomplish in mathematics this year?"

Suggested methods for communicating mathematics - most of these are one-way

- problem-of-the-week in newsletters 
- take home games 
- parent-teacher interviews

## Foster respectful relationships

Takes a more explicit focus at encouraging families to engage in math at home

- Suggest starting by finding a shared mathematical purpose (e.g. reducing energy use at home)
- students are important to forging these relationships

## Positive attitudes to mathematics

- importance of attitudes to performance
- active encourage opportunities to see/do/talk about mathematics

## Demystify mathematics and build confidence

- helping provide families with confidence to help their children with mathematics
