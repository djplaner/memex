Anglicare report - [The Poverty Premium](https://www.anglicare.asn.au/publications/the-poverty-premium/) - makes a similar point as [[boots-theory]].

From a related [ABC News report](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-12/anglicare-poverty-premium-low-income-australians-cost-of-living/102843886)

> Low income households face higher living costs than other families because they are financially penalised for being unable to buy groceries in bulk, pay costs annually instead of monthly, or upgrade to a more fuel-efficient car.

> In a new report, Poverty Premium: The high cost of poverty in Australia, Anglicare has identified six major areas of the economy where low income households are forced to pay what is essentially a poverty tax. 

> The areas include: food and groceries, transport, energy, credit and finance, data and communications, and home and car insurance.

> "It costs more to be poor," the report says.

> "People living on low-incomes often pay more for the same basic goods and essential services than people on higher incomes. There are so many examples," it says.
