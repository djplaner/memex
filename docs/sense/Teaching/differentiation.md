Main (2020)

> Differentiated instruction is: 
> − an approach that supports the learning of all students 
> − student centred 
> − a specific way to think about and plan instruction 
> − curriculum, pedagogy and assessment that are carefully planned and aligned to meet the needs of all students 
> − a range of approaches provided to content, process and product 
> − a dynamic blend of whole-class, small-group and individual instruction 
> − engagement of all students in respectful and challenging tasks.
> ... 
> Teachers can diffentiate in:
> - content—what students should know 
> - process—what students should be able to do 
> - products—how students demonstrate their learning 
> - learning environment—both the physical and affective domains of a classroom.
