title: Low Floor, High Ceiling, Wide Walls

Resnick and Silverman (2005) offer

> The Logo programming language is often described as having a low floor and high ceiling: it is easy for novices to get started (low floor) and possible for experts to work on increasingly sophisticated projects (high ceiling). In our own work (especially in recent years), we have put less emphasis on high ceilings and more emphasis on what might be called “wide walls.” That is, we have tried to design technologies that support and suggest a wide range of different explorations.

## Mathematics

D'Ambrosio & Katsberg (2008) offer

> In considering high expectations and worthwhile opportunities for all, Hiebert and his colleagues (1997) describe the importance of the tasks chosen for instruction in supporting all students. They describe tasks with multiple access points as those that allow students to engage in meaningful inquiry by drawing on whatever mathematical knowledge and experiences they know are useful in solving the task at hand. Tasks with multiple access points create opportunities for all students to engage in the construction of mathematical understanding. Tasks that limit students’ accessibility can result in a meaningless experience for many. Still, tasks must be problematic and deal with important mathematical ideas in order for the student to garner something meaningful from the assignment.

### Low-threshold, high ceiling tasks

Boaler and others reinforce the importance of including all. From De Geest & Lee (2019)

> Other characteristics of ‘low-threshold, high-ceiling tasks’ are: they offer multiple methods, pathways and representations; inquiry opportunities are included; they involve asking the problem before teaching the method; they add a visual component; and they ask pupils to convince and reason and to be sceptical (Boaler, 2016, p. 90).

### Low-floor, open-middle, high-ceiling tasks

Liljedahl (2020, p. 23) offers the following definitions 

| Task type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Low-floor task | a threshold that allows any and all learners to find a point of entry, or access, and then engage within their level of comfort  |
| High-ceiling task | have ambiguity and/or room for extensions such that students can engage with the evolving complexity of the task |
| Open-middle | A problem structure where a task has a single final correct answer, but in which there are multiple possible correct ways to approach and solve the problem |
