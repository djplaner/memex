Place to draw together [[my-teaching-philosophy]], [[my-approach-to-teaching-mathematics]], and [[my-approach-to-teaching-digital-technologies]] into actual plans and resources for implementation

Aim perhaps being that each class has a page that supports

- visualising the entire term, the lessons within it and the themes/resources between them
    - including details from unit plans, curriculum etc
- place to store specific ideas and resources for each lesson
