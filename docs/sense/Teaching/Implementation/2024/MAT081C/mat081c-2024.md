Implement planning and resources for MAT081C in 2024.

## Term 1

### Foci

- solve problems involving the 4 operations with integers and positive rational numbers [[AC9M8N04]]
- use mathematical modelling to solve practical problems involving percentages [[AC9M8N05]]
- conduct statistical investigations [[AC9M8ST04]]
  - explain the implications of obtaining data through sampling [[AC9M8ST01]]
  - analyse and describe the distribution of data [[AC9M8ST02]]
  - compare the variation in distributions of random samples of the same and different size from a given population with respect to shape, measures of central tendency and range [[AC9M8ST03]]

### To do

My approach

- Convert the foci into

    - [ ] Goompi model slides to explain where in mathematics they fit and why we're doing it

- Know and do table 

    - [ ] Figure out if/how to demonstrate accessibly the K&D table
    - [ ] Should the know be expanded?

School required

- [ ] Differentiation - learning support, DLC 

### Questions and ideas

For the Year 8 team

- Any common pretests being used - statistics and integers?
- What exactly is a portfolio task?
- What are the homework expectations in Year 8?
