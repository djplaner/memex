## To do

- [ ] Integrate [[notice-and-wonder]] into all lessons - and introduce it here with the [[number-scrabble]] activity
- [ ] Define difference between norms and expectations
- [x] Obtain/design the 15 presentation/app

    - [[number-scrabble]] implemented as [[number-scrabble-web]]
- [X] Get a [[random-group-allocator]]

## Unit plan description

### Learning outcomes

Students will 

- Link the purpose and expectations of this class to the schools ASPIRE and PBL Principles
    - Ambition, Self-belief, Perseverance, Integrity, Respect, Empathy
- Explain the "big picture" outcome of this class
    - safe & respected, learn how to think mathematically, useful and enjoyable
- Describe and follow the expectations for the class
    - start to grasp their application
- Early understanding of the routines we will follow
    - mathematical thinking
        - [[notice-and-wonder]]
        - [[number-talks]]
        - [[low-floor-high-ceiling-wide-walls]]
    - explicit teaching
    - mathematical practice
        - wax on, wax off

## Learning activities

### Purpose - if it is to be

Students

- Write down matras 
- Ponder the question of "it"
- Share with the class what it might be.
- Do NOT move the desks

Teacher

- Ensure students get it written down and ponder the question
- Help students without books/pens
- Share the origins of these mantras and rationale
  - My year 7 teacher - Mr. Buntain
  - But only the first
    - Which was kind of right - learning is only done by you (in the end)
    - Kind of wrong - before you get there there's a lot of influence from context
  - Second matra is important - in this class we all impact each other's ability to learn
    - My main task is to help you learn, but I need your help with your learning
    - Also your help with the learning of others
- What is it
    - Ask the class what is the "it" in the context of this class
    - **have identified some names to call upon**




### Plan for the lesson

- You
- Class purpose, expectations, & routines
- Mathematics
- What's next?

**TODO** 

- Seating plan 
  - Explore student details 
  - Update slide with plan

- Learning goals 
  - Check the wording

- Survey
    - print the survey

- Pre-test
    - print the test

## Slides

- Very early [Implementation slides](./welcome.html)


- Anonymous survey - [[mathematics-class-survey]]

    - Survey to find out more: you, school and mathematics
    - To feed into all that we do
    - Model some of the stuff about sampling etc.
