## Unit plan description

Routines and expectations, goal setting, pretest (statistics)

WALT

- Explore routines, classroom expectations, goal setting and review our understanding of number

WILF 

- Explain the importance of classroom routines & expectations
- Identify your goal and strategies to achive it
- Write your quiz responses

TIB 

- We want a positive and product math classroom for the year. I want to know what you know mathematically.

## My Planning

- [slides](./welcome.html)

To do

- [ ] Integrate [[notice-and-wonder]] into all lessons - and introduce it here with the [[number-scrabble]] activity
- [ ] Define difference between norms and expectations
- [x] Obtain/design the 15 presentation/app

    - [[number-scrabble]] implemented as [[number-scrabble-web]]
- [ ] Get a random group generator

    - [group generator](https://github.com/togarci/GroupGenerator) - simple web page/javascript
    - [python version](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/02-Python/EXTRA-Randomize-Students.html)

    - Expectations and routines
    - Mathematics

- You

    - Survey to find out more: you, school and mathematics
    - To feed into all that we do
    - Model some of the stuff about sampling etc.

- Expectations and routines

- Mathematics 

    - pre-test 
    - [[number-scrabble]] activity using [[number-scrabble-web]] and handouts

        - to demonstrate student thinking about mathematics and introduce Goompi model
        - group activity - 3 people

            - random group allocation
            - 1 or 2 rounds with them sharing

        - Goompi model 

            - introduce magic square

- Our class

    - Overview of what's next using Goompi model
    - Exit ticket - one minute summary - take up some place
