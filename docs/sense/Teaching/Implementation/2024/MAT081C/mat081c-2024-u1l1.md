## To do

- [ ] Integrate [[notice-and-wonder]] into all lessons - and introduce it here with the [[number-scrabble]] activity
- [ ] Define difference between norms and expectations
- [x] Obtain/design the 15 presentation/app

    - [[number-scrabble]] implemented as [[number-scrabble-web]]
- [X] Get a [[random-group-allocator]]

## Unit plan description

Routines and expectations, goal setting, pretest (statistics)

WALT

- Explore routines, classroom expectations, goal setting and review our understanding of number

WILF 

- Explain the importance of classroom routines & expectations
- Identify your goal and strategies to achive it
- Write your quiz responses

TIB 

- We want a positive and product math classroom for the year. I want to know what you know mathematically.

## My Planning

- [Implementation slides](./welcome.html)

### Learning outcomes

Students will 

- Explain the "big picture" outcome of this class
    - safe & respected, learn how to think mathematically, useful and enjoyable
- Describe and follow the expectations for the class
    - start to grasp their application
- Early understanding of the routines we will follow
    - mathematical thinking
        - [[notice-and-wonder]]
        - [[number-talks]]
        - [[low-floor-high-ceiling-wide-walls]]
    - explicit teaching
    - mathematical practice
        - wax on, wax off

## Learning activities

### Purpose - if it is to be

Students

- Write down matras 
- Ponder the question of "it"
- Share with the class what it might be.
- Do NOT move the desks

Teacher

- Ensure students get it written down and ponder the question
- Help students without books/pens
- Share the origins of these mantras and rationale
  - My year 7 teacher - Mr. Buntain
  - But only the first
    - Which was kind of right - learning is only done by you (in the end)
    - Kind of wrong - before you get there there's a lot of influence from context
  - Second matra is important - in this class we all impact each other's ability to learn
    - My main task is to help you learn, but I need your help with your learning
    - Also your help with the learning of others
- What is it
    - Ask the class what is the "it" in the context of this class
    - **have identified some names to call upon**




### Plan for the lesson

- You
- Expectations and routines
- Mathematics
- What's next?

### You

- Anonymous survey - [[mathematics-class-survey]]
- Pre-test

    - Survey to find out more: you, school and mathematics
    - To feed into all that we do
    - Model some of the stuff about sampling etc.

### Purpose II - purpose of class

use diagram showing the purpose of the class

- Society/School expectations 

    - safe 
    - respected
    - learning maths
- My purpose

    - mathematical mindset
    - useful and enjoyable

### Expectations 

Goompi model
mathematical mindsets - Boaler and Ingram

### Routines

- explicit teaching
    - me active
    - student active questioning
- you active
    - number talks
    - notice and wonder
    - other examples
- 

### Mathematics 

- pre-test 
- [[number-scrabble]] activity using [[number-scrabble-web]] and handouts

    - to demonstrate student thinking about mathematics and introduce Goompi model
    - group activity - 3 people

        - random group allocation
        - 1 or 2 rounds with them sharing

    - Goompi model 

        - introduce magic square

- Our class

    - Overview of what's next using Goompi model
    - Exit ticket - one minute summary - take up some place
