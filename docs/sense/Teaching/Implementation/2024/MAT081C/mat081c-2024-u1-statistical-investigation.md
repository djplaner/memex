Where I'll start my more detailed planning for my version of the unit.

### Content and pedagogy resources

- [TIMES - Data investigation and interpretation - year 8](http://amsi.org.au/teacher_modules/Data_Investigation_and_interpretation8.html)
- [M1Maths statistics](https://m1maths.com/im-statistics.html)
- [MathisFun data](https://mathsisfun.com/data/index.html)
- [Mathematics hub - Year 8 statistics](https://www.mathematicshub.edu.au/planning-tool/8/statistics/)
- ?? advice/resources on conducting investigation


#### Specific resources

Steam and leaf plots

- [interactive stem and leaf plot generator](https://jeroenjanssens.com/stem/) - simple textarea, put in data and generates a basic stem and leaf plot - [gist](https://gist.github.com/jeroenjanssens/6395842) has the code
- [Khan academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/displaying-describing-data/quantitative-data-graphs/a/stem-and-leaf-plots-review) review page has some detail and offers a collection of questions testing ability to read a stem and leaf plot


## Driving question

Possibilities

- **How do we know if someone is lying with data?** 
- How can we make better data-informed decisions?  
- How do we use data to make better decisions?  
- What decisions are important to me?

Search for examples

- Which toothpaste should I buy?
- illustrate types of decisions that might need making

## Planning

- Driving question - Can I use this data to make a meaningful comment on a more general situation?
- _Question_ [ ] Can the student survey from the first lesson be used as an exemplar?

    - What type of data source is it?
    - What types of variables are there?
    - Draw on Likert styles from other similar surveys and use them to explore bias?

- _task_ [ ] Explore use of Australian Census data in the region as practical example/data source

    - [Census site](https://www.abs.gov.au/census)
    - Next census in [2026](https://www.abs.gov.au/census/2026-census-topic-review), last in 2021 on [this topic list](https://www.abs.gov.au/census/find-census-data/census-data-topic)
    - [2021 students data](https://www.abs.gov.au/articles/education-australia-abc-bs-and-cs) - some nice graphs
    - [JJJ hottest 100 kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mijames/jjj-hottest-100) (tsv file)
    - [Better intersections dataset](https://betterintersections.jakecoppinger.com/about) - includes articles researching the problems arising from lengthy waits at intersections

        - [Guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/sep/09/placebo-buttons-australian-pedestrians-press-for-no-reason-at-traffic-lights) includes nice visualisation
    - Car colour - various online stories

    - Use of PISA data - including recent information about students not trying

- _idea_ [ ] Ask each student in the class to generate a sample to collate results and use to compare variation across samples

    - important for illustrating variability 
    - different samples could be designed to explore different types of variability

- _point_ [ ] Surveys encouraging people to register an opinion are considered very unreliable - use popular online/phone surveys
- _task_ [ ] In general identify contemporary examples of bad sampling for nefarious means

    - [Misuse of statistics - datapine](https://www.datapine.com/blog/misleading-statistics-and-data/) - interesting story about Colgate, and various others - but largely a US focus
    - [Statistics flawed in media](https://news.mit.edu/1994/statistics-1019) - 1994 article that describes some good examples

- _task_ [ ] What visualisation methods for reveal/web can I use for dotplots and steam-and-leaf plot

    - including ways to visualise variation and range

## Lessons

13 lessons

- ~7 teaching
- ~6 investigation

### Lesson 2 - Samples & Populations

Learning outcomes

- Understand the difference between a sample & a population
- Understand the various methods of collecting data (survey, census, questionnaire)

    **Question** The relationship between "collecting data" and "collecting primary" data seems arbitrary

- Select an appropriate sample and know if it is biased or not
- Explain where you've seen data used in life - food, sports, online


| Terms | Definitions | Examples and activities |
| ----- | ----------- | ----------------------- |
| Population | The group of things to make conclusions about | Give concrete examples (PISA, hottest January - 2024 versus 1964, and Oz census ) to illustrate the size of populations, which are then illustrated below |
| Census | Process of gathering information from the whole population | - hottest temperature<br>- australian census data |
| Survey | Process of gathering information from a sample |  | 
| Sample | | |
| Representative sample | | |
| Questionnaire | | |
| Observation | | |
| Measurement | | |
| Bias | | |
| Primary data | | |
| Secondary data | | |

#### Lesson activities

Starter

- perhaps a [[notice-and-wonder]] activity with data/conclusions from a couple of the chosen "statistical investigations" or perhaps just data

    Perhaps a bit too group for a starter, but perhaps a leader into one of these might be useful. Could be just a TPS type activity.  Aim here being perhaps to get them asking questions about bias, sample size, how do people know?

ToC

- Introduce the driving question - including the Goompi version
- use some of the sample SIs to draw out more discussions link to the Goompi model
- touch on what we'll do in this lesson and the rest of the unit

Tour of statistical investigation samples

- Delve more deeply into the different samples to introduce and illustrate the different terminology
- Can we get them recording/discussing/filling out some sort of worksheet with details on whether or not the different types of terminology helps/hinders drawing conclusions etc. -- better, structure it with questions that they can use for their own statistical investigation
- For example

    - What's the population?
    - What's the sample?
    - What methods were used to gather the data?
    - What's the variation?

### Lesson 3 - Primary & Secondary data

Learning outcomes

- Understand the difference between primary and secondary data
- Understand various methods of collecting primary data (observation, measurement & surveys)
- Understand the source and reliability of secondary data
- Considering the constraints on them gathering data (small to medium)

### Lesson 4 & 5 - Organising & displaying data

### Lesson 6 - Measures of centre & spread

### Lesson 7-8 Assignment lessons


- Hand out
- Decide their topic

### Lesson 10-11 Assignment lessons

- Collect data from other class
- Construct graph from frequency table

### Lesson 12 - Analysing data

### Lesson 13-14 Assignment lessons

- Analyse data
- Write report
