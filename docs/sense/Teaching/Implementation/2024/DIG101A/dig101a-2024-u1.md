to do

- Sample unit plans
    - [ACARA work sample - python game development](https://v9.australiancurriculum.edu.au/resources/work-samples/technologies/digital-technologies/years-9-and-10/digital-project--python-game-development-) - is very detailed and long
    - [What do the data really reveal?](https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaltechnologieshub.edu.au%2Fmedia%2Ftselhjgn%2F9-10-assessment_task-what-does-the-data-tell.docx&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK) - detailed assessment task
- Assessment
  - What are some appropriate types and levels
    - ACARA sample work stuff
    - CSER links explicitly to the cognitive verbs
    - CSER - breaks out the achievement standards
- Grok 
  - What learning resources are there

## Cameron's initial design

Building on Year 9, this unit focuses on enhancing the sustainability projects with advanced digital technologies, particularly object-oriented programming, to create functional digital applications that address environmental issues.

Weeks 1-15: Enhancing Digital Solutions with Object-Oriented Programming

- Focus: Introduction and application of object-oriented programming to enhance sustainability projects.
- Curriculum Content:
    - AC9TDI10P09: Implement, modify, and debug modular programs.
    - AC9TDI10P10: Evaluate digital solutions against design criteria.
- Elaborations:
- Learning and applying object-oriented programming concepts.
- Assessing the effectiveness of the Year 9 prototype and identifying areas for enhancement.
- Student Activities: Programming tutorials and project development sessions.
- Assessment: Progress report documenting the enhancement process.

## DJ's thoughts

Add a couple more content descriptions and shape into a developmental sequence that achives the goal - enhancing digital solutions.

- Revisit programming and gain experience using project management tools

    Some of these (e.g. the first two) might just be revision - touching on these to ensure students have some capability
    - Revisit algorithm design 
      - AC9TDI10P05 - design algorithms involving logical operators and represent them as flowcarts and pseudocode
    - Debugging and understanding code  
      - AC9TDI10P06 - validate algorithms & programs by comparing output against a range of test cases
    - actual programming 
      - AC9TDI10P09 - Implement, modify, and debug modular programs 

    Some of the above could be done while evaluating/refamiliarising students with the Year 9 prototype

    Leading up to the assessable work. Introduce the notion of OOP and a more collaborative approach to code.
    - AC9TDI10P09 - Implement, modify, and debug modular programs - focus on OOP
    - AC9TDI10P12 - Use simple project management tools to manage individual and collaborative agile projects

- Evaluate and design

    - AC9TDI10P04 - define and decompse real-world problems with design criteria by interviewing stakeholders to create user stories
    - AC9TDI10P08 - generate, modify, communicate and criticall evaluate alternative designs
    - AC9TDI10P09 - Implement, modify, and debug modular programs

Relevant standards elaborations

- decomposition of real-world problems
- design and validation of algorithms
- development and modification of innovative digital solutions
- implementation of algorithms, including in an OOP
- use of advanced features of digital tools to / plan, collaborate and manage agile projects
- plan and manage projects using an iterative and collaborative approach, identifying risks and considering saftey and sustainability



## Learning experiences

AfL 

- Regular lesson "exit" tickets to QLearn - KWL/3-2-1 etc.
- project milestones

Learning

- Draw on cogntive verbs/achievement standards for 7/8 and 9/10

## Assessment

Part 1 K&S development (sample task)

- [Sample task](https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitaltechnologieshub.edu.au%2Fmedia%2Ftselhjgn%2F9-10-assessment_task-what-does-the-data-tell.docx&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK) uses the idea of two parts to an assessment task with the first being K&S development
- 15 activities to provide the necessary skills - in this case around a specific data set
- These could be taken from Grok learning - python coding type activities - 

Part 2 - Understanding and skill application (assessment)

- students choose their dataset
