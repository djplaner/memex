## Random thoughts and planning

### Teaching ideas

### Teaching tools

- ACARA assessment task uses [Spyder IDE](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) - the Conda distribution is likely more flexibl

### Project ideas

Systems development

- Some sort of distributed, ?generative? art that includes user input and keeping safe?
- Implementing a suite of animations/interactive systems for teaching mathematics (etc)
- Streamlit/Javascript (Material) projects around public data - for the Lockyer Community


QCAA planning document suggests four units

1. Websites

    Respond to brief "be creative" by designing website to "change the world" 

    - user experience
    - data compression
    - content/presentation
2. Gamification

    Learn about gamification and design a user experience (and implement it) for a game. Implement it.  Test and predict results.

3. Big data

    Big data in the context of organisations...create a digital solution with big data.

4. IoT

    Explore smart farming IoT etc...

Data

- [ACARA sample assessment](https://www.digitaltechnologieshub.edu.au/media/tselhjgn/9-10-assessment_task-what-does-the-data-tell.docx) focuses on the data aspect using a combination of sample task and assessment task using Excel and Python to examine data


### Python programming ideas

Looking for a creative coding idea with Python that starts with basic Python and touches on OOP.

- [Creative coding in Python book](https://www.creativecodinginpython.com/) - apparently used in schools
- [Damon Murtagh](https://github.com/DamoM73) - secondary teacher teaching Python - range of useful sites
    - Including OOP with rooms etc.

### From Grok to real programming

Need to take basics in Grok into building actual Python programs - stepping stone to assessment

- [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/) - way to share Jupyter notebooks

    a web application that lets you enter the URL of a Jupyter Notebook file, renders that notebook as a static HTML web page, and gives you a stable link to that page which you can share with others. nbviewer also supports browsing collections of notebooks (e.g., in a GitHub repository) and rendering notebooks in other formats (e.g., slides, scripts).
- [Code club projects](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/codeclub)

    Includes a range of "cards"/projects specific to Python (etc). From Raspberry PI and provides a code editor that might be interesting.  But these soon get fairly complicated and high level.  Might be useful to guide what I show the students??

- [Code wars](https://www.codewars.com/) - Practice code katas

- [Code guppy](https://codeguppy.com/blog/coding-projects-for-middle-and-high-school-students/index.html) more creative computing oriented, but with javascript - is a coding platform.

- [Project examples](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/python-projects-for-beginners/) - list of ideas - some fairly boring

    But some - [analyse my Netflix usage](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/python-tutorial-analyze-personal-netflix-data/) might be interesting. Does use Jupyter Notebooks, pandas so advanced. Very advanced.  But there is some notion of objects with pandas???

#### [Hour of Python](https://hourofpython.com/) - various short challenges and tutorials

- [Visual introduction](https://hourofpython.trinket.io/a-visual-introduction-to-python#/welcome/an-hour-of-code) is a lesson that follows the Grok learning model (largely) using Turtles, but does explicitly establish [Turtles as objects](https://hourofpython.trinket.io/a-visual-introduction-to-python#/multiple-turtles/turtles-are-objects). Turtle graphics as a way to introduce OOP. Perhaps as a segue into OOP.

- [Teach London unplugged ideas](https://teachinglondoncomputing.org/free-workshops/programming-unplugged-programming-without-computers/)
    - [Create a fcace programming a robot](https://teachinglondoncomputing.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/activity-create-a-face.pdf)
    - [Variables and boxes](https://teachinglondoncomputing.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/activity-boxvariables.pdf) and [related](https://teachinglondoncomputing.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/activity-assignmentdryrunpython.pdf) - could be a useful self-assessment

- [Classic CS unplugged] - Collection of unplugged activities - from a book avilable as PDF - [other resources available](https://www.csunplugged.org/en/resources/)
    - [Binary numbers (with cards)](https://classic.csunplugged.org/documents/activities/binary-numbers/unplugged-01-binary_numbers.pdf) - looks good, could be used with Crackers
    - [Image representation](https://classic.csunplugged.org/activities/image-representation/)

### Curriculum resources

### Curriculum Content

Summary 

- should develop and modify innovative digital systems 
  - from analysis, design (user experience and implementation)
- OSMEN with complex data - turning into document: content, structure and presentation
- collaborate on and manage agile projects
- apply privacy principles to manage digital footprints

#### Digital systems (K&U)

[[AC9TDI10K01]] - h/w and s/w manage, control, and secure access to data in networked digital systems

#### Data representation (K&U)

- HTML/CSS etc?? [[AC9TDI10K02]] - represent documents online as content (text), structure (markup) and presentation (styling) and explain why such representations are important
- [[AC9TDI10K03]] - investigating simple data compression techniques 

#### Acquiring, managing and analysing data (process & production skills)

Echoes of OSMEN

- [[AC9TDI10P01]] develop techniques to acquire, store and validate data from a range of sources
- [[AC9TDI10P02]]  analyse and visualise data interactively using a range of software - to draw conclusions, make predictions, trends and outliers
- [[AC9TDI10P03]]  model and query entities

#### Investigating and defining

Is this really how user stories should be developed?

- [[AC9TDI10P04]]  define and decompose real-world problems with design criteria and by interviewing stakeholders to create user stories 

#### Generating and designing

Design a system of some sort both user experience and implementation - link with the user stories above.

- [[AC9TDI10P05]]  design algorithms involving logical operators and represent them as flowcharts and pseudocode
- [[AC9TDI10P06]]  validate algorithms and programs by comparing output against a range of test cases
- [[AC9TDI10P07]]  design and prototype the user experience of a digital system
- [[AC9TDI10P08]]  generate, modify, communicate and critically evaluate alternative designs

#### Producing and implementing

- [[AC9TDI10P09]] implement, modify & debug modular programs, applying selected algorithms and data structures, including in an OOP language

#### Evaluating

- [[AC9TDI10P10]] - evaluate existing and student solutions against design criteria, user stories, possible future impact and opportunities for enterprise

#### Collaborating and managing

- [[AC9TDI10P11]] - select and use emerging digital tools and advanced features to create and communicate features to create & communicate interactive content for a diverse audience
- [[AC9TDI10P12]] - use simple program management tools to plan/manage individual and collaborative agile projects, accounting for risks and responsibilities.

#### Privacy and security

- [[AC9TDI10P13]] - develop cyber security threat models and epxlore software, user or software supply chain vulnerabiity
- [[AC9TDI10P14]] - apply Australian Privacy Principles to critique and manage the digital footprint that existing systems and student solutions collect
