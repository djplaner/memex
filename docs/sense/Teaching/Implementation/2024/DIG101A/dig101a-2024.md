## Random thoughts and planning

### Teaching ideas

### Teaching tools

- ACARA assessment task uses [Spyder IDE](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) - the Conda distribution is likely more flexibl

### Project ideas

Systems development

- Some sort of distributed, ?generative? art that includes user input and keeping safe?
- Implementing a suite of animations/interactive systems for teaching mathematics (etc)
- Streamlit/Javascript (Material) projects around public data - for the Lockyer Community


QCAA planning document suggests four units

1. Websites

    Respond to brief "be creative" by designing website to "change the world" 

    - user experience
    - data compression
    - content/presentation
2. Gamification

    Learn about gamification and design a user experience (and implement it) for a game. Implement it.  Test and predict results.

3. Big data

    Big data in the context of organisations...create a digital solution with big data.

4. IoT

    Explore smart farming IoT etc...

Data

- [ACARA sample assessment](https://www.digitaltechnologieshub.edu.au/media/tselhjgn/9-10-assessment_task-what-does-the-data-tell.docx) focuses on the data aspect using a combination of sample task and assessment task using Excel and Python to examine data

### Curriculum resources

- [QCAA 9/10 DT curriculum and assessment plan](https://www.qcaa.qld.edu.au/downloads/aciq/technologies/digital-technologies/teaching/ac_tech_digital_yr09-10_ca_plan.docx)

### Curriculum Content

Summary 

- should develop and modify innovative digital systems 
  - from analysis, design (user experience and implementation)
- OSMEN with complex data - turning into document: content, structure and presentation
- collaborate on and manage agile projects
- apply privacy principles to manage digital footprints

#### Digital systems (K&U)

[[AC9TDI10K01]] - h/w and s/w manage, control, and secure access to data in networked digital systems

#### Data representation (K&U)

- HTML/CSS etc?? [[AC9TDI10K02]] - represent documents online as content (text), structure (markup) and presentation (styling) and explain why such representations are important
- [[AC9TDI10K03]] - investigating simple data compression techniques 

#### Acquiring, managing and analysing data (process & production skills)

Echoes of OSMEN

- [[AC9TDI10P01]] develop techniques to acquire, store and validate data from a range of sources
- [[AC9TDI10P02]]  analyse and visualise data interactively using a range of software - to draw conclusions, make predictions, trends and outliers
- [[AC9TDI10P03]]  model and query entities

#### Investigating and defining

Is this really how user stories should be developed?

- [[AC9TDI10P04]]  define and decompose real-world problems with design criteria and by interviewing stakeholders to create user stories 

#### Generating and designing

Design a system of some sort both user experience and implementation - link with the user stories above.

- [[AC9TDI10P05]]  design algorithms involving logical operators and represent them as flowcharts and pseudocode
- [[AC9TDI10P06]]  validate algorithms and programs by comparing output against a range of test cases
- [[AC9TDI10P07]]  design and prototype the user experience of a digital system
- [[AC9TDI10P08]]  generate, modify, communicate and critically evaluate alternative designs

#### Producing and implementing

- [[AC9TDI10P09]] implement, modify & debug modular programs, applying selected algorithms and data structures, including in an OOP language

#### Evaluating

- [[AC9TDI10P10]] - evaluate existing and student solutions against design criteria, user stories, possible future impact and opportunities for enterprise

#### Collaborating and managing

- [[AC9TDI10P11]] - select and use emerging digital tools and advanced features to create and communicate features to create & communicate interactive content for a diverse audience
- [[AC9TDI10P12]] - use simple program management tools to plan/manage individual and collaborative agile projects, accounting for risks and responsibilities.

#### Privacy and security

- [[AC9TDI10P13]] - develop cyber security threat models and epxlore software, user or software supply chain vulnerabiity
- [[AC9TDI10P14]] - apply Australian Privacy Principles to critique and manage the digital footprint that existing systems and student solutions collect
