## Purpose

Learning intentions

- Establish purpose, norms, and expectations
- Recall Digital Technologies learning experiences and outcomes 
- Explore the evaluation of digital solutions

Success criteria

- You are modelling norms and expectations
- We've identified ideas for improving our class this year 
- You can identify and apply some components of an evaluation 

## To do

- Know and do table based on current unit planning 
- [x] get resources/ideas for evaluating digital technology systems
- pre-test
    - [ ] design ?? maybe don't do it??
    - [ ] Implement in Canvas
- [ ] Set up qlearn course site
    - [ ] PBL focus
    - [ ] Details
    - [ ] Lesson 1 content
- how old are these students
- [x] variation on norms
- refine norms
- [x] Access the [QCAA portal](https://www.qcaa.qld.edu.au/logins/qcaa-portal/landing-page) for more resources from digital solutions
- [ ] Update crackers
  - [x] Update readme to have a play
  - [x] Remove the "for me" from the origins page
  - [x] fix the anchor to the git repo

- [ ] Create [Canvas minute paper (survey)](https://teaching.unl.edu/images/Workshops/Teaching_Strategies/Minute_Paper_How_To.pdf)

    - What was the most interesting thing you learned in today's lesson?
    - What questions do you still have about this class?
    - Any other comments?

## Activity sequence

### Welcome

- all seated in middle
- computers, books etc closed
- Ponder question - revisit later

    - What is Digital Technologies (this class) about?
    - Thoughts on the class so far
        - What's good?
        - What's not?
        - What would you like to see?

### Intentions and success

Outline these

### Purpose

Variation on standard

replace mathematical mindset with computational thinking, creative & critical creator with digital technology

### Norms

Variation

### Think/Pair/Share

Perhaps use random allocator

- What is Digital Technologies (this class) about?
- Thoughts on the class so far
    - What's good?
    - What's not?
    - What would you like to see?

Prompt questions

- What is a digital technology?
- What do you think of PBL points?
- What do you see yourself over the next few years? What are you working toward? (maybe not)

### Routines


### QLearn

- Lesson tasks/resources
- Exit tickets / project milestones
- 

### You and digital technologies

Some sort of survey

- computer literacy
- computational thinking capability
- coding capability


Maybe [Griffith digital skill](https://griffithunilibrary.github.io/digital-dexterity/dd_quiz/story.html) - upload result to group page

### pre-test


### Evaluating a digital technology

Get them to evaluate [crackers](https://crackers.streamlit.app/)

- What is it? What's the purpose?
- What would make a good one?
- How does it work?

### Exit ticket 

- Use of qlearn to respond
