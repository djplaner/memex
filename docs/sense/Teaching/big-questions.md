Monreal (2015) cites Perkins (2014) definition

> Big questions address particular themes about humanity, our world, and our universe. There are also very general big questions that find significance in almost any context. The child’s ‘why’ is prelude to the ‘why’ of a scientist, artist, or historian. Likewise, the child’s ‘how’ looks toward the engineer or politician or manufacturer. The broadly exploratory question ‘what’s there’ touches everything from the interior of cells to the interiors of black holes. (p. 74)

Link to _live hypotheses_ possibilities that are a real issue/interest for the individual. Worth engaging with.
