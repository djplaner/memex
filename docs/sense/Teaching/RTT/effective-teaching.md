Second module in the ACU Return to Teaching course. 

Through the [[APSTs]] connect into a repertoire of teaching approaches. Which appear to be an almost random collection of learning theories, pedagogical practices, specific approaches. 

Might have been useful to include more [[design-for-learning]] and [[evolution-of-design-for-learning]]. Also the Learning Sciences, evidence based practice etc are visibly absent - at least in the summary. Given their prevalence in debates - e.g. around PISA - this is a little surprising.

## Repertoire of teaching practices

### Constructivism

As explained is resonates somewhat with a [[design-for-learning]] approach. We learn through activities, perhaps changing/perhaps not our mental models. Teaching aims at understanding students' pre-existing conceptions and guides activity to build/change them.

But with a focus on problem-solving and inquiry-based learning activities. "Constructivism transforms the students from a passive recipient of information to an active partipant in the learning process"

!!! question "On the tendency toward straw folk arguments?"

    This perspective has echoes of the straw man approach of the explicit teaching crowd and how they characterise non-explicit teaching methods. Echoes of the issues with [[not-how-bad-you-start]] and [[all-models-are-wrong]]

### Inquiry-based learning

As described here it is being positions as a high level pedagogy to match the philosophy of constructivism. Misc. video resources about school implementation.

### Scaffolding student learning

Nice analogy with ancient bridge building. Defines the Zone of Proximal Development and links.

### Providing feedback

General points about feedback linked to idea of formative feedback. Includes feedback model from Hattie & Timperley (2007) 

Perhaps most interesting from the diagram are the three questions and four levels summarised in the tables following.

| Label | Question |
| --- | --- |
| Feed up | Where am I going? (the goals) |
| Feed back | How am I going? (progress towards the goal) |
| Feed forward | Where to next? (activities to close the gap) |

| Level | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Task | How well tasks are understood/performed |
| Process | The main process needed to understand/perform tasks |
| Self-regulation | Self-monitoring, directing, and regulating of actions |
| Self | Personal evaluations and affect (usually positive) about the learner |

!!! note "All models are wrong and somewhat contradictory"

    The "repertoire" of teaching practices is a collection of models. Models that have something to say about specific bits of the complex tasks/practices of learning and teaching. As well as [[all-models-are-wrong]], they are also somewhat contradictory.

    Hattie's work, at least for me, smacks more of the technical (goal focused, teacher led) than critical (exploratory, student focused). Inquiry-based learning and constructivism can/are focused the other way.

    But perhaps that is to be expected, all models are wrong but they may be useful if they are gathered together and woven into ways that are appropriate for the specifics. Which connects to my idea of [[teaching-as-gather-weave-augment]], but also [[teaching-as-interweaving]]

Move's onto Dweck's growth mindset work related to praise and the big idea of students providing feedback to teachers (traffic lights, thumbs up/down).

### Play-based learning

Bit on the approach, including expansion out to "symbolic-play" but doesn't say much about if/when applicable beyond early years. 

### Cooperative teaching practices

Apparently team teaching/planning is a relatively new advent.

### Teaching with ICT

Does interchangeably use the terms ICT and electronic technologies.

####  Reflection task

> Laptop computers, iPads, smart boards, data projectors and other ICT devices are increasingly common in our classrooms. The use of these devices can be a challenge - both practically and pedagogically.
> Reflect on your use of ICT in your teaching. Share a success story (it can be something very simple!). 

Somewhat in contrast to Carly, what I'm nervous about as I return to school are the limitations Ed Qld places on digital technologies, rather than my skills. Perhaps not surprising given digital technologies is one of my teaching areas and I've spent the last 30 years using (and helping others use) digital technology to enhance/transform learning and teaching. That experience has reinforced that the practical and pedagogical challenges to using digital technologies are ever present. But at the same time even the simplest use of digital technologies can offer a pedagogical benefit.

An example of this was from the very first lesson I taught as a student teacher in a joint English/Mathematics class for Year 8s. The lesson "Timezones and Mass". My mentor - the mathematics teacher - had established a routine of using an interactive white board and a set of slides to scaffold lessons. Following that practice I designed a set of slides. The timezones section started with the following slide with an image of specific international locale and the question "What time is it here, right now?". A spark of recognition and discussion arose from one of the student tables. A spark I encouraged to spread to the rest of the class through questioning etc. 

The image is of a part of Cape Town, South Africa including Table mountain. It was sourced via a Google image search specifically because I'd discovered that one of the students was originally from Cape Town. He knew what the time was and was able to confirm what we covered on timezones. His situation allowed this bit of mathematical knowledge to be contextualised and its value demonstrated in a concrete way. At the same time, it was achieved using a simple digital technology in a pedagogical form that was common and consistent with the class's experience. For that first lesson, I want to minimise any chance of those practical and pedagogical challenges.

Though  Those practical and pedagogical challenges stil



Using _digital technologies_ and helping other teachers use _digital technologies_ to enhance and transform learning & teaching has been the primary focus of that career.



## Assessment task

### Part 1

Choose FOUR of the contemporary approaches provided and 

- Define each of the approaches/issues in your own words;
- Identify how each relates to the professional issues

    i.e. clearly identify the standards and focus areas being discussed

### Part 2

Choose one of the teaching approaches and explain how you might use digital technologies to support your teaching and student learning. Include some description of context at the start.
