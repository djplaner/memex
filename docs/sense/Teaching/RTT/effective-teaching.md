Second module in the ACU Return to Teaching course. 

Through the [[APSTs]] connect into a repertoire of teaching approaches. Which appear to be an almost random collection of learning theories, pedagogical practices, specific approaches. 

Might have been useful to include more [[design-for-learning]] and [[evolution-of-design-for-learning]]. Also the Learning Sciences are visibly absent - at least in the summary

## Repertoire of teaching practices

### Constructivism

As explained is resonates somewhat with a [[design-for-learning]] approach. We learn through activities, perhaps changing/perhaps not our mental models. Teaching aims at understanding students' pre-existing conceptions and guides activity to build/change them.

But with a focus on problem-solving and inquiry-based learning activities. "Constructivism transforms the students from a passive recipient of information to an active partipant in the learning process"

*Critique:* this perspective has echoes of the straw man approach of the explicit teaching crowd and how they characterise non-explicit teaching methods. Echoes of the issues with [[not-how-bad-you-start]]



## Assessment task

### Part 1

Choose FOUR of the contemporary approaches provided and 

- Define each of the approaches/issues in your own words;
- Identify how each relates to the professional issues

    i.e. clearly identify the standards and focus areas being discussed

### Part 2

Choose one of the teaching approaches and explain how you might use digital technologies to support your teaching and student learning. Include some description of context at the start.
