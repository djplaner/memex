## Overview

Focus on reflection on provided information organised as above. Assessment 6 posts x ~300 words.


## Teaching is an art form

Starts with [Ken Robinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Robinson_(educationalist)) [video "Teaching is an Art Form, Teachers are artists!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd9zlxuNDFg&t=68s).  Places importance on creativity (not surprisingly)

- Curriculum - needs to evolve
- Teaching and learning - roles of teacher is changing
- Assessment
- Partnership with community (learning communities) 

## Misc bug-bears and reflections

### Canvas

With module navigation is a pain. e.g. not being able to access a ToC of a module from a page within the module.
