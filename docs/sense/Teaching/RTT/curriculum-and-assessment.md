Fourth module in the ACU Return to Teaching course. 

## Curriculum

### Australian Curriculum

Melbourne Declaration - support 21st C learning. Importance of knowledge, skills, and understanding of learning areas, general capabilities, and cross-curriculum priorities

Covers some of the same ground as [[australian-curriculum]] though with version 8.4 of the oz curriculum (not v9)

#### Literacy resources

- [VCE literacy in mathematics](https://www.education.vic.gov.au/school/teachers/teachingresources/discipline/english/literacy/Pages/introduction_to_literacy_in_mathematics.aspx)

### QCE

Recent new version of QCE - key features

- New QCAA senior syllabuses
- external assessment in most senior subjects 
- introduction of ATAR 
- new QA process for quality/comparability of school-based assessment
- Changes to QCE eligibility requirements

## Assessment & Reporting

Mentions (at some length) formative and summative assessment. Some points on both summarised

Reliabilty - extent to which an assessment can be trusted to give consistent information about students' progress

Validity - does it measure all that might be important to measure

### Formative

-   be part of effective planning,
-   focus on how pupils learn
-   be central to classroom practice
-   be a key professional skill
-   be sensitive and constructive
-   foster motivation
-   promote understanding of goals and criteria
-   help learners know how to improve
-   develop the capacity for self-assessment
-   recognise all educational achievement

### summative

-   pupils to be actively engaged in monitoring their own progress;
-   teachers to understand and be able to articulate the nature of the progress being aimed at;
-   teachers to be skilled at using a range of methods to assess pupil learning;
-   teachers to adopt manageable recording procedures that enable them to keep track of each pupil's learning, without feeling obliged to record everything;
-   teachers to be able to communicate effectively with each pupil.

### Assessment encouraging self-regulation

Nicol and Macfarlane-Dick (2006) describe 7 principles for assessment the encourages self-regulation

1. Clarify what good performance is 
2. Facilitate self-assessment 
3. Deliver high quality feedback information 
4. Encourage teacher and peer dialogue 
5. Encourage positive motivation and self-esteem 
6. Provide opportunities to close the gap
7. Use feedback to improve teaching

#5 might be reframed with [[growth-mindset]] ideas - is self-esteem the intent, or encourage effort?

### Using data to inform teaching and learning


## Assessment tasks

### Reflection

#### Supporting literacy as a general capability

> In the Australian Curriculum, students become literate as they develop the knowledge, skills and dispositions to interpret and use language confidently for learning and communicating in and out of school and for participating effectively in society.
>
> Literacy involves students in listening to, reading, viewing, speaking, writing and creating oral, print, visual and digital texts, and using and modifying language for different purposes in a range of contexts (multiliteracies).
> 
> While much of the explicit teaching of literacy occurs in the English learning area, it is strengthened, made specific and extended in other learning areas as students engage in a range of learning activities with significant literacy demands. 
> 
> These literacy-rich situations are a part of learning in all curriculum areas. Paying attention to the literacy demands of each learning area ensures that students’ literacy development is strengthened so that it supports subject-based learning.
> 
> Share a literacy success story - or share your experience of an approach that did not work out so well!

**engage more with oz curriculum on literacy**

Literacy
> ability to read and use written information and to write appropriate in a range of contexts…integration of speaking, listening, viewing and critical thinking with reading and writing and includes cultural knowledge

**Plan**

- again reflection on observations and a plan, rather than reflection on success
- not a lot of discplinary literacy practices in either mathematics or digital technologies - at least not explicit
- literacy after all is the something like learning to manage texts within a context
- what context should occur in the classroom - what is specific
- Would need to

  - Connect with what students know and can do
  - familiarise them with the literacies of the discipline
  - scaffold their engagement with those literacies
    - hark back to the "challenge" book chapter about "external reading"
  - Mention Downes model and ?? approach
  - But also develop the ability to critique these given approaches
    - But also sharing more contemporary approaches - Viv ??? math doodles

#### Using data to inform your teaching

**Missing, has duplicate starter text to the above**

### Assignment

> Part 1: Suggested length: 100-150 words
>
> Briefly list and explain some of the recent changes to the curriculum that have taken place in your area of teaching.
>
> Part 2: Suggested length: 200-300 words
>
> Literacy and numeracy are key components of the Australian Curriculum at all levels. As a way to draw together your thinking on literacy and numeracy, record your perspectives in response to the following:
>
> 1. What is literacy? What does it mean to be literate?
> 1.  What is numeracy? What does it mean to be numerate?
> 1.  What does literacy and numeracy look like in your teaching context: (i.e, the early years, primary school years, or secondary school)?
> 1.  Describe some strategies that you can use to develop the literacy and numeracy capabilities of your students in curriculum areas other than Mathematics and English.
>
> Part 3: Suggested length: 100 words
> 
> Choose one of the cross-curriculum priorities or general capabilities (other than literacy and numeracy) from the Australian Curriculum. Describe some strategies that you could use to incorporate your chosen area into your teaching (Hint: be specific).
