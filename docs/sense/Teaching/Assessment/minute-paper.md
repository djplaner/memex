title: Minute paper
type: note
---

A minute paper asks students to take a minute at the end of a class or topic to answer, traditionally on paper, a small number, usually one or two, of questions about the class. The most common two questions are:

1.  What was the most important thing you learned during today's class?
2.  What question(s) remain upper-most in your mind? Or, what is the muddiest point still remaining at the conclusion of today's class?

But there are many other [possible questions](#possible-questions)


## Prior writing

From a [2009 blog post](https://djon.es/blog/2009/02/27/minute-papers-encouraging-relection/)

The minute paper is one way to help promote meta-cognitive thinking amongst students and to provide academics with ungraded, anonymous, immediate feedback from their students in order to assess how well and how much they have learned (Murphy & Wolff, 2005). Empirical tests have found that students completing minute papers scored higher than those who did not (Murphy & Wolff, 2005). For academic staff, minute papers raise the awareness of student experience and misunderstandings and provide an opportunity to reflect on teaching. Also it is a mechanism through which the academic demonstrates respect for and interest in student opinion and encourages the student’s active involvement in the learning process (Angelo & Cross, 1993). Unlike other forms of course evaluation the minute paper can be explained to students as a vehicle for improving their own on-going instruction rather that that of future students (Chizmar & Ostrosky, 1998).

 If minute papers are overused or poorly used it can be seen by students as a gimmick or pro forma exercise in polling (Angelo & Cross, 1993). Murphy and Wolf (2005) found that as the semester progressed a few students became “bored” with the minute papers and gave rushed and trivial responses to the questions. It is difficult to prepare questions that can be easily understood and quickly answered (Angelo & Cross, 1993). Implementing the one-minute paper in an online form did not achieve the same response rate as a paper-based version but was superior in that students provided longer responses, provided the instructor with greater flexibility with replies and were automatically archived for future use (Murphy & Wolff, 2005).

 ## Possible questions

-   What was the most important / significant / surprising / useful / challenging thing you learned during this class?
-   What questions do you (still) have after today's class?
-   What did you learn today that you didn't know before? That you think will be useful in your career? That made you think differently about something?
-   What did you learn today that made you want to learn more about something?
-   How can what we discussed in class today be applied to a real-world situation?
-   How can what we discussed today be applied to other classes or subjects?
-   How does what we discussed today relate to other things we have learned in this class or other classes/subjects?
-   How does what we covered in today's session relate to current events or issues in society or the world at large?
-   How does what we talked about in class today relate to your own experiences or background?
-   How does what we learned today relate to your own interests or passions?
-   How does what we learned today challenge or confirm your beliefs or assumptions about something?
-   How does what we learned today connect with other things you have read, watched, or listened to recently?
-   How does what we learned today connect with other things going on in your life right now or in the near future (e.g., projects, assignments, exams)?
-   If you had to summarise the main aim of today's lesson, what would it be?
-   How do you think you're tracking so far in this subject / unit / class?
-   What questions do you have about this unit / subject / the assessment?
