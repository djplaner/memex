    A very different take on the nature, design, and use of rubrics. Set in the K12 context, but has some promise (and challenges) for HE context. A [comment](https://www.cultofpedagogy.com/hyperrubric/#comment-492853) links this approach to the idea of _innovation configuration maps_ from the concerns-based adoption model. 

    > IC maps are very specific about what is being done (not what is not being done or using vague descriptors (“some”) to assess). IC maps also don’t use a specific number of columns to hem in the creator.
