Place to think out loud and develop ideas. Goal being to be
>  helping to produce assessment design that is intellectually robust, manageable, and resistant to AI technologies.

## What to do about assessments?

[What to do about assessments if we can't out-design or out-run AI?](https://educational-innovation.sydney.edu.au/teaching@sydney/what-to-do-about-assessments-if-we-cant-out-design-or-out-run-ai/) - points to [more detailed pdf](https://unisyd-my.sharepoint.com/personal/danny_liu_sydney_edu_au/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fdanny%5Fliu%5Fsydney%5Fedu%5Fau%2FDocuments%2FEI%2F2023%2Fgenerative%20AI%2FAssessments%20for%20semester%202%2C%202023%2Epdf&parent=%2Fpersonal%2Fdanny%5Fliu%5Fsydney%5Fedu%5Fau%2FDocuments%2FEI%2F2023%2Fgenerative%20AI&ga=1)

- help teachers ensure assessment changes have longevity
- provide opportuntiies to reflect on human side of L&T
- help students prepare for AI-augmented careers
- encourage ethical, accountable and transparent use of AI


## Ten myths

Liu (2023) points out that some common approaches no longer apply

- LLMs can access recent references (post 2021) - not true.
- Can't get references right - not true at least for specific tools.
- Can't write reflectively - Yes they can outperform students (Li et al 2023)
- Can't do calculations or use contemporary class resources - different LLMs can - e.g. Finance
- Authentic assessment is AI proof - no

## General good advice

- Do students understand why/how this assessment task fits more broadly with their learning, careers etc.

## LLM specific

Michael Sankey [presentation](https://www.slideshare.net/michaelsankey/principles-of-assessment-259432099), includes some suggestions

- Teaching students how to use generative LLMs
- Enabling students to become creators with LLMs
  - provide feedback on their writing
  - simplify complex information
  - scaffold information on specific task
  - helpful for diverse students (neurodivergent/NESB)
  - In essence, create their own learning resources
- Work around LLMs
  - Balance essays with other kinds of assessments 
  - Design assignments where students demonstrate understanding independent of written works
  - "authentic assessments"
  - personalised or complex tasks

- Overview of LLM operations 
- Moving onto TEQSA discussion paper
- Onto Griffith actions - mostly institutional
  - Apparently an L&T CoP??? - [L&T site](https://griffitheduau.sharepoint.com/sites/LTSupportResources/SitePages/AI-tools-in-learning-and-teaching.aspx)
