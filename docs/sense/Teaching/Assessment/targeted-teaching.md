A variation/extension of [[assessment-for-learning]] where teacher knowledge (and evidence of that knowledge) about each student's learning is used to adapt [[design-for-learning]].

Suggested it involves

- setting goals for students informed by data;
- creating targeted strategies;
- reassessing to check progress and providing individualised feedback;
- further assessing for retention and understanding beyond simple recall.
