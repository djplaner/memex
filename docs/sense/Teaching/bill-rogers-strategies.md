# Bill Rogers' - on the spot strategies



Rogers (2005), p. 95

> Discipline is effectively leading, guiding and teaching children to own (and be responsible for) their behaviour in the context of respecting others’ rights (Rogers 1998). The elements of effective and positive discipline involves a challenging balance between prevention, correction, encouragement, support and repairing and rebuilding. ([Rogers, 2005, p. 95]

1. Gain attention, pause and then give a direction 

    Use a brief, sharp attention-getting tone, then drop to a normal/assertive tone. Perhaps describe what you are seeing before giving a behavioural direction.

2. Don’t ask ‘why questions‘ – when dealing with small misbehaviours 
3. Use partial agreement (maybe-but) to stop conversations going off on a tangent 
4. Use conditional permission (when-then) when students ask to do something 
5. Give students a forced choice when a direction has been ignored
6. Approaching a student side-on may be seen as less threatening
