# Bill Rogers' - on the spot strategies

See also: [[behaviour-management]]


1. Gain attention, pause and then give a direction 
2. Don’t ask ‘why questions‘ – when dealing with small misbehaviours 
3. Use partial agreement (maybe-but) to stop conversations going off on a tangent 
4. Use conditional permission (when-then) when students ask to do something 
5. Give students a forced choice when a direction has been ignored
