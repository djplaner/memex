A key concept in database design and perhaps the [[relational-model]]. A _functional dependency_ defines one field as an anchor that can always be used to find a single value for another field.

!!! question "Why?"

    FDs and [inference rules](#inference-rules) help find [keys](#keys-and-candidate-keys) and develop [[normal-forms]] for relational databases.

Functional dependency connections written using an arrow (→) notation. For example, if A and B are attributes of a relation R, then A → B means that for each value of A there is exactly one value of B. In other words, the value of A determines the value of B.

!!! note "Not a unique key"

    A FD does not imply a unique key for other attributes. Only that A determines the value of B

## Inference rules

Various rules can be applied to functional dependencies, including:

- **Reflexive** If X is a composite composed of A and B, then X → A and X → B
- **Augmentation** If X → Y, then XZ → YZ for any Z
- **Transitivity** If X → Y and Y → Z, then X → Z
- **Decomposition** If X → YZ, then X → Y and X → Z
- **Union** If X → Y and X → Z, then X → YZ

### Keys and candidate keys

- As attribute that will identify all other attributes in a row is a _candidate key_
- Intent is to identify the fewest number of attributes to identify all other row attributes
- Given some initial FDs, apply the inference rules to find all possible FDs, looking for the one with the smallest number of attributes on the left side of the arrow that can define all other attributes in the relation
