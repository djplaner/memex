Revisiting data modelling ER models and SQL.

## ER Diagrams (ERD)

ERDs are a subset of "semantic models". Intended to produce a high-level database model disconnected from any particular logical model (relational, hierarchical, object-oriented, or network)

Claims about ERDs:

1. Simple and easily understood by nonspecialists.
2. easy conceptualised, the basic constructs are intuitive and provide a natural way of representing a user's information requirements 
3. a model that describes a world in terms of _entities_ and _attributes_ suitable for computer-naive end users.  But students may have difficulty grasping the concepts.

There is no standard ER diagram (ERD) model

- Originally developed by Chen

    Does not require thinking about how the database wil be implemented. Mostly used by universities for instruction
- Various authors, including Chen have refined the Chen model
- Barker/Oracle-like models are also commonly used

    Barker like model more closely tied with the relational model.

## Data models

### Hierarchical model

## Definitions

_Database_ - a collection of related data

_structural constraints_ consist of two notions

- _cardinality_  - how many of one record type relate to another record type and vice versa
- _optionality_ - whether or not
