A conception of how people engage (including publish) with the web that escapes large corporations (Big Web, Big Tech etc). Different conceptions fo the small web can differ on specific principles or foci.


!!! note "Web 2.0 considered problematic"

    As someone who played with and advocated for Web 2.0 back in the day it is sad/interesting to see it now get lumbered with Big Tech.

## Principles

### Small technology

[Small technology](https://small-tech.org/about/#small-technology)
- easy to use
- personal

    Tools for people, not startups/enterprises.
- private by default
- share alike

    Reliance on copy-let as a way to cultivate a healthy commons.
- peer to peer

    No reliance on a middle-entity (e.g. corporation/government) for people to connect.
- interoperable
- zero knowledge

    A zero knowledge tool has no knowledge of your data.
- non-commercial
- non-colonial

    Made by humans for humans. If targeting a group, development teams reflect that group. Connecting with the idea of avoiding do-it-to/for and focusing on do-it-with or enabling DIY.
- inclusive

### Small web

[The Small Web is Beautiful](https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/)

- Small software
- Small websites
- Emphasize server-side, not Javascript
- Static sites and site generators
- Fewer dependencies
- Small analytics
- Small architectures

### Big web versus small web

[Big web versus small web](https://small-tech.org/research-and-development/#big-web-vs-small-web)

| Big Web |	Small Web|
| --- | --- |
| Trust the server |	Don’t trust the server |
| Don’t trust the client |	Trust the client |
| Owned by corporations |	Owned by individuals |
| Call people “users” |	Call people “people” |
| Servers have many users (multi-tenant) |	A server has one owner
(single-tenant) |

    Going back, even to the extent of writing plain HTML. Pointing out the issue with any sort of technical stack, with a static site generator generating error messages due to dependency issues. _Response_ using a stack that I'm using all the time, not just for publishing the site. But he also points out that it won't work for largish sites.
