# Parson's problems

Parsons Problems are a type of educational exercise or problem-solving activity commonly used in computer science and programming education. The concept of Parsons Problems was introduced by Dr. Kate Sanders and Dr. Quintin Cutts in their 2008 paper titled "Using Parsons Problems to Bootstrap Interest in Computer Programming."

In Parsons Problems, learners are presented with a programming task that requires them to rearrange a set of provided code snippets to construct a correct program. The code snippets are pre-written and can include both correct and incorrect statements or lines of code. The goal of the exercise is for learners to arrange the code snippets in the correct order to solve the problem.

The key idea behind Parsons Problems is that they focus on the structural aspects of programming rather than the syntactic details. By providing the code snippets, learners are relieved of the burden of remembering the exact syntax and can concentrate on understanding the logical flow and structure of the program. This approach helps beginners develop problem-solving skills and a better understanding of programming concepts without getting overwhelmed by syntax errors.

Parsons Problems can be implemented using different formats. For example, the code snippets may be presented as blocks of text that learners need to reorder, or they can be provided as drag-and-drop elements that learners arrange in the correct sequence. Additionally, Parsons Problems can be used with different programming languages and cover a wide range of topics and difficulty levels.

Research has shown that Parsons Problems can be an effective pedagogical tool in computer science education. They help learners build mental models of program structure, enhance problem-solving abilities, and provide a low-stress environment for practicing programming concepts. Parsons Problems also encourage active learning and engagement, making them particularly valuable for introductory programming courses and online learning environments.
