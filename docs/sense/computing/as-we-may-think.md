title: As We May Think

Bush's (1945) article comes from the perspective of a person who directed the work of thousands of US scientists during World War II. A person starting to think about what next. While acknowledging the benefits science has brought the suggestion is made that the methods by which people engage in knowledge management is limited. Based on the latest technology of the period he imagines a device called the Memex which would allow people to store and retrieve information. 

## Associated trails

A key contribution is the idea of _associative trails_. The ability for people to create and share sequences of related resources that are usefully associated with each other.

The [[colophon]] for this site identifies the technologies that are orchestrated to enable associative trails for this site. First, [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) provides an authoring environment for easily creating associative links between bubbles (aka notes). When publishing a [[computational-components|computation component]] extracts and adds the "related" links (aka back links) to each bubble to make associated trails more visible/navigable.

## Orchestration of technologies

Bush (1945) does recognise that the technologies (like Memex) rely on the availability of other assemblages of technologies that enable their effective creation and management. e.g. the example of how ancient Egypt would struggle to build a car. Echoing [[drons-technology|Dron's point about technology]] because created by orchestrations of other technologies.

At one level, Bush's (1945) article gives a detailed description of how technologies of his time (perhaps with some extrapolation) could be orchestrated to provide a much better way of managing knowledge. This orchestration then enables a more effective - even transformative - way of knowledge workers (i.e. any with an interest) orchestrating their engagement with knowledge.

> He urges that men of science should then turn to the massive task of making more accessible our bewildering store of knowledge. (Bush, 1945, p. 35)

> Now, says Dr. Bush, instruments are at hand which, if properly developed, will give man access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages. (Bush, 1945, p. 35)

> this paper by Dr. Bush calls for a new relationship between thinking man and the sum of our knowledge. (Bush, 1945, p. 35)

> Now, as peace approaches, one asks where they will find objectives worthy of their best. (Bush, 1945, p. 37)

> There is a growing mountain of research. But there is increased evidence that we are being bogged down today as specialization extends. (Bush, 1945, p. 37)

> Mendel’s concept of the laws of genetics was lost to the world for a generation because his publication did not reach the few who were capable of grasping and extending it; (Bush, 1945, p. 37)

> The summation of human experience is being expanded at a prodigious rate, and the means we use for threading through the consequent maze to the momentarily important item is the same as was used in the days of square-rigged ships. (Bush, 1945, p. 37)

> Had a Pharaoh been given detailed and explicit designs of an automobile, and had he understood them completely, it would have taxed the resources of his kingdom to have fashioned the thousands of parts for a single car, and that car would have broken down on the first trip to Giza. (Bush, 1945, p. 38) 

One of many similar points about an advanced technology is not "alone". But dependent upon an ecosystem of other technologies. Strong echoes of Dron - new technologies are built using assemblies of existing technologies.

> A record, if it is to be useful to science, must be continuously extended, it must be stored, and above all it must be consulted (Bush, 1945, p. 38)

> The cord which trips its shutter may reach down a man’s sleeve within easy reach of his fingers. A quick squeeze, and the picture is taken. (Bush, 1945, p. 38) 

Part of Bush's extrapolation of the future improvements to cameras and how they might be used. Echoes of dash cams and go pros, but he missed the digital aspect and its enabling of always on use. Illustrating the difficulty of predicting future technologies.

> s not enough; one needs not only to make and store a record but also to be able to consult it, and this aspect of the matter comes later. Even the modern great library is not generally consulted; it is nibbled by a few. (Bush, 1945, p. 39) 

Starting the transition from extrapolating current (1945) technologies to demonstrate how they could store large amounts of information. Moving to the need to be able to easily consult/use this massive library of information and record information

> But creative thought and essentially repetitive thought are very different things (Bush, 1945, p. 40) 

A possible connection here between Foam/Memex enabling easy linking and connection making between bubbles (creative thought) and computational components supporting more repetitive thought (e.g. listing all the native plants at wood duck meadows)

> The repetitive processes of thought are not confined, however, to matters of arithmetic and statistics. (Bush, 1945, p. 41)

> In fact, every time one combines and records facts in accordance with established logical processes, the creative aspect of thinking is concerned only with the selection of the data and the process to be employed, and the manipulation thereafter is repetitive in nature and hence a fit matter to be relegated to the machines. (Bush, 1945, p. 41)

> A mathematician is not a man who can readily manipulate figures; often he cannot. He is not even a man who can readily perform the transformation of equations by the use of calculus. He is primarily an individual who is skilled in the use of symbolic logic on a high plane, and especially he is a man of intuitive judgment in the choice of the manipulative processes he employs. (Bush, 1945, p. 41)

> So much for the manipulation of ideas and their insertion into the record. Thus far we seem to be worse off than before—for we can enormously extend the record; yet even in its present bulk we can hardly consult it. This is a much larger matter than merely the extraction of data for the purposes of scientific research; it involves the entire process by which man profits by his inheritance of acquired knowledge. The prime action of use is selection, and here we are halting indeed. (Bush, 1945, p. 42)

> Our ineptitude in getting at the record is largely caused by the artificiality of systems of indexing. When data of any sort are placed in storage, they are filed alphabetically or numerically, and information is found (when it is) by tracing it down from subclass to subclass. (Bush, 1945, p. 43)

> The human mind does not work that way. It operates by association. With one item in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the association of thoughts, in accordance with some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain. It has other characteristics, of course; trails that are not frequently followed are prone to fade, items are not fully permanent, memory is transitory. Yet the speed of action, the intricacy of trails, the detail of mental pictures, is awe-inspiring beyond all else in nature. (Bush, 1945, p. 43)

> A memex is a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory. (Bush, 1945, p. 43)

> And there is provision for direct entry. (Bush, 1945, p. 44)

> All this is conventional, except for the projection forward of present day mechanisms and gadgetry (Bush, 1945, p. 44)

> It affords an immediate step, however, to associative indexing, the basic idea of which is a provision whereby any item may be caused at will to select immediately and automatically another. This is the essential feature of the memex. The process of tying two items together is the important thing. (Bush, 1945, p. 44)
