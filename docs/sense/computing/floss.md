_Free-Libre and Open Source Software_  ([FLOSS](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html)) is a somewhat contested term for talking about the various perspectives on open source software - 

A key distinction is the use of the French/Spanish word _libre_ to emphasise "free" as in _freedom_ not the absence of cash cost.
