_Free-Libre and Open Source Software_  ([FLOSS](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html)) is a somewhat contested term for talking about the various perspectives on open source software - 

A key distinction is the use of the French/Spanish word _libre_ to emphasise "free" as in _freedom_ not the absence of cash cost.

## Contributions to FLOSS

Since the mid-1990s I have been an active user of and occasional contributor to FLOSS. in 1994 I taught a course on Linux Systems Administration which ended up generating an [open source "textbook"](https://djon.es/blog/2008/12/22/an-introduction-to-linux-systems-administration-4th-edition/index.html). All of my prior software projects have been released under FLOSS licenses. Some of them - [BIM](https://djon.es/blog/research/bam-blog-aggregation-management/) and the [Card Interface for Blackboard](https://djon.es/blog/2021/03/12/reflecting-on-the-spread-of-the-card-interface-for-blackboard-learn/index.html) - were actually used by people.

Now with more time on my hands it is time to exploring making contributions to active FLOSS projects. A list the currently includes:

- [[foam-dev]]
