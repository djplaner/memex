Comparing the "old" dark age with its three layers (my phrasing) with current day

| Label | Old Dark Age | New Dark Age | Description |
| Power | The Church | [Tech's Frightful Five](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/10/technology/techs-frightful-five-theyve-got-us.html) | the power, the source of exploitation, the autocrats |
| Enablers | Literate monks | Technical folk | standing above the commoners through use of Latin. The literate monks - writing, translating - were the "studious, high-aptitude socially awkward nerds of their day - beavered away on tasks assigned them by their anointed masters" |
| Exploited | Illiterate serfs | Computer users | Digitally illiterate | 

Raises the question about whether there will be a second enlightenment. Raising the question of what will be the equivalent of the printing press, publishing the bible in common language and creating the tipping point


!!! question "Has anyone questions the position of the bible as the tipping point for the second enlightenement?"

    Seems a bit simplistic for that one event to be the sole cause.

## Age of digital enlightenment

Lane hopes such a new age would be
> characterised by enabled communities, where self-reliance and empowerment are championed ("the user is the developer) rather than sneered at by the fearful, insecure masses.
