As of 2025, most individuals' experience with the web is through spaces controlled by large corporations (aka Big Web/Big Tech/Web 2.0). Fighting against this are various alternate conceptions with a significant emphasis on [[digital-humanism]].

## Examples

    - Decoration when needed, no unrelated content
    - Performance is a feature


## Conceptual ideas

There are many alternative conceptions of the web each with their own principles, focii and often community. Examples include (but certainly are not limited to):

- [[small-web]]
- [smolweb](https://smolweb.org/index.html)). 

    Principles including

        - Own your own data 
        - Use & publish visible data 
        - Make what you need 
        - Use what you make
        - Document your stuff
        - Open source your stuff
        - UX and design is more important that protocols, formats, data models, schema etc
        - Modularity
        - Longevity
        - Pluralism
        - Have fun
