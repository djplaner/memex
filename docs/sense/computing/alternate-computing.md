    Short segments of DNA replace traditional wiring to form circuits. Modelled and then implemented with tubes filled with DNA strands and buffer fluid to encourage attachment. Use these to construct DNA-based programmable gate arrays which can then be combined to perform different tasks (e.g. solving quadratic equations, taking square roots etc)
