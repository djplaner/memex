My working definition is that digital humanism is about putting people, individuals, communities etc at the centre of technology. Or, drawing on [[drons-technology|Arthur/Dron's definition of technology]] - the orchestration of phenomena for a purpose - ensuring that the _orchestration_ and _purposes_ are driven by people, individuals, and communities. Not companies etc.  Or, perhaps are at least used _purposefully_ by people, individuals, and communities.

From the [Digital Humanism Initiative](https://caiml.org/dighum/)

> People are the central focus. Technology is for people and not the other way round. We need to put “humankind” at the center of our work.

## Digital culture

Our culture isn't about digital computing being creative, protean. It's about use.

[Seymour Papert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhEovwWiniY&t=106s)

> If you go into any school or any home you'll find many pencils, many crayons, many paintbrushes. Because these are instruments that people are made part of their lives. They use the pencil whenever they have a need for it to draw, to write a story, to calculate, and so with a computer it's the natural instrument for doing mathematics, for music for a hundred other things.  our goal is to make it sufficiently part of the culture of the place that everybody uses it when it's needed there

## Concepts/ideas 

- [habituating the user](https://codeactsineducation.wordpress.com/2023/06/10/pedagogpt/) an idea that platform companies etc "create training schemes to operate as "habituation programs" - see Williamson et al (2022)
- [making the user friendly](https://codeactsineducation.wordpress.com/2023/06/10/pedagogpt/) - similarly arguing that the aim of tech company training programs is to _make the user friendly_ for all the stuff/assumptions baked into the technology - see Gorur & Dey (2021)

## From the Digital Humanism Initiative 

> The Corona-Crisis shows that IT keeps the system running. But at the same time IT is changing our society. We are in the midst of the digital transformation, with computer science and its artifacts as a major driver. We experienced the metamorphosis from the stand-alone computer to the global operating system of our world, a journey leading to yet another industrial revolution: digitizing everything, and automating work and thinking.

> This digital and global operating system integrates, links, and permeates everything: work, leisure, politics, the personal, the professional, and the private. It influences or even shapes actions on a technical, economic, military, and political level.

> Whereas digitalization is opening unprecedented opportunities, it also raising serious concerns: the monopolization of the Web, the rise of extremism orchestrated by social media, the formation of filter bubbles, the loss of privacy, the spread of digital surveillance, automated decision making, and the potential loss of jobs due to automation.

> ... 
> Such an approach starts from several key points:

> -    IT forms a critical building block for our society; it facilitates and drives change, but it also needs rules and guidance.
> -    To understand, to reflect, and to influence this development, we need a multi and interdisciplinary approach, looking at the individual and the society.
> -    It is a global international issue.
> -    The approach needs to be scientific, in the tradition of the enlightenment – and fact based in the best sense.
> -    **People are the central focus. Technology is for people and not the other way round. We need to put “humankind” at the center of our work.**
