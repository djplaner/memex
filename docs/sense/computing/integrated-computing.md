title: Integrated Computing 
---

Idea - apparently from K-12 education in the US - to teach computer science topics - progrmaming and computer literacy (rather narrow?) - within (integrated into) traditional subjects.

## Origins?

Is it a phrase getting broader acceptance, or limited to a researcher? 

- [Integrated computing site](https://integratedcomputing.org/) - includes a repository of resource
- [Margulieux's research](https://laurenmarg.com/research/)

- [New approach to teaching computer science could broaden the subjectâ€™s appeal](https://theconversation.com/new-approach-to-teaching-computer-science-could-broaden-the-subjects-appeal-205171)

## Other views 

- [NSW syllabus for "integrated computing"](https://educationstandards.nsw.edu.au/wps/wcm/connect/d118aac0-0c05-4c94-9b18-5c46bad4bbe4/integrated-computing-7-10-2019-draft-syllabus-for-consultation-2019-pdf.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&CVID=) - appears to be a more traditional separated approach
