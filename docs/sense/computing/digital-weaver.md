A [[digital-renovator]] is someone who modifies the digital environment to better suit their purpose. [Recent work](../../sense/Paper-Ideas/gatherers-weavers-augmenters.md) has brought up the idea of a digital weaver.

The idea is that much of the work of a digital renovator is automating and augmenting the [gathering and weaving together](../CASA/bad_set-casa-gather-weave.md#gathering-weaving-and-epistemic-fluency) disparate strands.
