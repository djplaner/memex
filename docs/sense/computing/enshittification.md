title: Platform Decay (enshittification)
type: note
---

Term defined by Cory Doctorow to describe a pattern of evolution in the behaviour/quality of online platforms. Drawing heavily on recognising such platforms as [two-sided markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-sided_market).

The model Doctorow describes is:

1. Platforms are good to their users.

    Often offering services at a loss to grow the user base to make the platform attractive to business customers.
2. Then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers.
3. They then abuse their business customers to generate value for the platform.

The solution depends on two general principles

1. The _end-to-end_ principle - the platform must provide the customer with exactly what the want - the "message" is delivered safely from end to end.
2. The _right to exist_ - allowing users to move if they are dissatisifed. The ability to move requires _interoperability_.
