title: Digital Garden
type: note

A digital garden is a personal website located somewhere between a personal blog and a wiki. A collection of notes/essays/ideas. Evolutionary, exploratory, and forever incomplete the notes/essays/ideas of a digital garden are linked through contextual associations, rather than organised by publication date, categories, or other formal scheme.

[Non-technical gardening](https://maggieappleton.com/nontechnical-gardening) argues that digital gardens are:

- **Explorable** - deeply inter-linked that can be navigated freely, rather than structured and linear.
- **Slowly grown over time** - never done, always being revised

### Stream vs Garden

Mike Caufield [2015 presentation/blog post dives deep](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/) into a comparison of the stream (blogs) and digital gardens, which includes the following quote:
> Everybody wants to play in the Stream, but no one wants to build the Garden. ([Caulfield, 2015])

### Stoak and Flow
- [Stock and flow](https://snarkmarket.com/2010/4890/) - 2010 post by Robin Sloan explaining the difference between the concepts of 
  - **Stock** - "is the durable stuff. it's the content you produce that's as interesting in two months (or two years) as it is today..."
  - **Flow** - "is the feed. It's the posts and the tweets. It's the stream of daily and sub-daily updates that reminds people you exist"
