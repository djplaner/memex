title: Digital Renovator

A digital renovator (perhaps aka [[digital-weaver]]) doesn't just accept the digital environment provided to them. Instead a digital renovator will make modifications so that the digital environment better suits their purpose. This is becoming easier and easier as the nature of the technologies better support this (but still perhaps not widespread).

Encouraging more people to engage in digital renovation is step toward emerging from the [[current-digital-dark-age]]

## Origins

A [2011 blog post](https://djon.es/blog/2011/07/31/residents-and-visitors-are-builders-the-forgotten-category/) was reflecting on [White's principle of _Visitors and Residents_](http://tallblog.conted.ox.ac.uk/index.php/2009/10/14/visitors-residents-the-video/#). Taking in ideas of digital technology being inherently protean, the digital computer as a meta-medium, and [Ruskoff's take](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/programming-literacy_b_745126) that "programming is a basic literacy". Then suggesting there is a need for a third category of _Builders_. Someone able to shape their digital world.

[Peter Albion](https://dralb.albion.id.au/) suggested the [idea of renovator/handyman/DIY enthusiast](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/programming-literacy_b_745126) as a better fit.
