title: Programming as a basic literacy skill

From Margulieux et al (2020)

> Understanding how to program a computer is becoming a basic literacy skill (Scaffidi et al., 2005). The idea of computer literacy is shifting from being only a consumer of technology (e.g., using Microsoft Office and browsing the Internet) to also including being a producer of technology (e.g., writing or adapting computer programs and making websites). Programming enables people to develop solutions that increase efficiency in their personal and professional lives, and software development is an in-demand career path in many sectors (US Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2017).
