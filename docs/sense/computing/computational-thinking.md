[This](https://www.fierceeducation.com/teaching-learning/teaching-computational-thinking-essential-future-college-students) identifies computational literacy as "an essential literacy" with four pillars 

1. Decomposition: breaking the problem into multiple parts
2. Pattern recognition: looking for similarities and trends
3. Abstraction: putting aside what is unnecessary and focusing on whatâ€™s important
4. Algorithm design: creating a computer artifact with step-by-step instructions to solve a problem
