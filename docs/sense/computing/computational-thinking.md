[This](https://www.fierceeducation.com/teaching-learning/teaching-computational-thinking-essential-future-college-students) identifies computational literacy as "an essential literacy" with four pillars 

1. [[decomposition]]: breaking the problem into multiple parts
2. [[pattern-recognition]]: looking for similarities and trends
3. [[abstraction]]: putting aside what is unnecessary and focusing on whatâ€™s important
4. [[algorithm-design]]: creating a computer artifact with step-by-step instructions to solve a problem

Wing (2006) defines computational thinking as 

> solving problems, designing systems, and understanding human behaviour, by drawing on the concepts fundamental to computer science (p. 33)
