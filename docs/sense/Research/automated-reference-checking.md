Exploration into various tools for automating the checking of references in academic writing. One approach to dealing with the rise of generative AI use in such writing.

!!! note "Nothing interesting found (yet)"

    A quick early look which wasn't really all that successful, nor complete.


## Tools that (may) leverage AI

Seems common for tools to leverage the original enabler to help with the problem

- [Referentia](https://refvalidation.org)

    Apparently free, single-page website. You upload a PDF and it does checks.

    Simple and well designed, but initial test gives 47 references found, but checking 38 of them had issues.

- [Academic Paper Reference Checker](https://github.com/markrussinovich/refchecker)]

    Python tool to be installed locally. Doesn't install correctly on the Mac (initially)
