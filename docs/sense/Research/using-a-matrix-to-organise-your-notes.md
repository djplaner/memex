title: Using a matrix to organise your notes
---
> A matrix helps you to organise your notes in a format that is easy to translate directly into your chapter draft. The idea is to identify themes you want to write about first so that you can read with more purpose and distill from the articles only what you need. You may find you think up more themes as you read and write. The table below is fictional, just to help you get the idea.
