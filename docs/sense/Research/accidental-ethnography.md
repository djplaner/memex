title: Accidental ethnography
type: note
---
A systematic/formal method for analysing data generated during previous fieldwork/practice to provide "insight into a phenomenon, culture, or way of life" (Levitan et al., 2020, p. 336). Levitan et al (2020) argue it's particularly useful for educational practitioners.

Levitan et al (2020, p. 367) define _accidential_ as

> post hoc practitioner data and experiences that can be used as research data not collected within a planned research study.

## Origins 

Early descriptions of AccE include:

- Poulos (2009) position AccE as a way of being. Not a specific research method.
- Fuji (2015) AccE to supplement/make more complete other formal research methods

## Position 

A key distinction between accidental ethnography and other methods (e.g. action research) is that AccE "explicitly focuses on past information and experience that was not collected as part of a pre-designed study and includes reflexivity and memory-work" (Levitan et al., 2020, p. 337).

As opposed to authoethnography (focused on individual learning)
> AccE is focused on the learning of a group, community, or organization, and utilizes practitioner-researcher experience as just one part of the research process, relying on extant data from the organization to test memories and corroborate findings.

Somewhat related to secondary data analysis, but SDA typically doesn't include the research gathering the data, hence may lack "the affective and subtle nuances of personal experience" provided by ethnographic methods.

Using empirical data distinguishes AccE from reflective essay etc.

## Method

Uses the "eight big tent" criteria

> ‘(a) worthy topic, (b) rich rigor, (c) sincerity, (d) credibility, (e) resonance, (f) significant contribution, (g) ethics, and (h) meaningful coherence.’’

Relies on 6 practices to address issues of quality and trustworthiness:

1. **Inititiation** 

    Experience which generates the need to reflect/research on practice.

2. **Reflection**

    Using foci to reflect on work. Use of writing to deepen understanding.

3. **Re-examination**

    Re-examine contemporary literature to find a space for how the practical experience contributes to theory or practice.

4. **Collect data**

    Gather existing data, perhaps generate some new, undertake data analysis and hypothesis testing.

5. **Coding**

    To uncover themes, trends and simply to explore.

6. **Recursive consultations**

    Looping research and reflection back to practice. To help the organisation/community contribute to and learn from the research.
