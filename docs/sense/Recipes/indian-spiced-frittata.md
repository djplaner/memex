Once had a recipe for a sausage frittata that used Indian spices and mango chutney, but I lost it. What follows is an attempt to recreate it inspired by the random collection of frittata recipes a web search revealed (not including the original recipe).

## Ingredients

Deep ovenproof frying pan

- 6 to 8 eggs
- 4 sausages (originally pork, but beef will do)

    - casings removed, and broken into small pieces

- 1-2 onions
- 1-2 garlic cloves
- 100ml milk
- Juice 1 lime
- 1 bunch fresh coriander
- handful of grated cheese (optional)

Spices

- simple

    - 1-2 tbsp of curry powder

- less simple

    - .25 tsp ground cumin 
    - .25 tsp ground coriander
    - .25 tsp turmeric
    - .25 tsp chilli powder
    - .25 tsp paprika
    - .5 tsp garam masala

Other fillings

- 1 capsicum
- 150g of spinach/cabbage

## Method

1. Preheat oven to 180C.
2. Heat the frying pan on the stove and add a little oil.
3. Add the sausages and cook until browned, breaking them up into small pieces.
4. Add the onions (and capsicum if using) and cook until softened.
5. Add the garlic and cook for another minute.
6. Add the spices and cook for a minute or two until fragrant.

    - (if using) Add the mango chutney and cook for a minute or two stirring.  

7. (if using) Add the spinach/cabbage and cook until softened.
8. In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, lime juice, and chopped coriander.
9. Pour the egg mixture over the sausage and vegetable mixture in the frying pan.
10. Turn down the heat and cook for 10 minutes. Egg will be set on the bottom but still runny on top.
11. Sprinkle the grated cheese on top if using.
12. Transfer the frying pan to the oven and bake for 10-15 minutes until the frittata is set and golden brown on top.
13. Remove from the oven and let it
