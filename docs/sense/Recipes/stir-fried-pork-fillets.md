## Kylie Kwong's Stir-Fried Pork Fillets


### Ingredients

- 600gm pork fillets cut into 5mm pieces
- .25 cup vegetable oil
- 6 spring onions, trimmed and cut into 10cm pieces
- 1 tbsp malt vinegar
- 1 tbsp light soy sauce
- 1 tbsp water
- 2 limes, halved

### Marinade

- 2 tbsp honey
- 2 tbsp light soy sauce
- 2 tbsp shao hsing wine or dry sherry
- 2 tbsp finely diced ginger
- 1 tbsp oyster sauce
- 2 tsp dark soy sauce
- 2 tsp five-spice powder
- .5 tsp sesame oil

### Method

1. Combine pork with the marinade ingredients in a large bowl, cover and leave to marinate in the fridge for 30 minutes or overnight.
2. Heat 2 tbsp of the oil in a hot wok until the surface seems to shimmer slightly. Add half the marinated pork and stir-fry for 30 seconds. Remove from the wok with a slotted spoon and set aside; heat the remaining oil in the work and add the remaining pork and stir-fry for 30 seconds.
3. Return the reserved pork to the wok with the spring onions, vinegar, soy sauce, water and lime halves. Stir fry a further minute or until the pork is cooked through and slightly browned.
