This recipe started with a couple of mistakes when trying to follow [ReciptTinEats' Soft easy chocolate chip cookies](https://www.recipetineats.com/chocolate-chip-cookies/#wprm-recipe-container-21670) recipe. The mistake outcome was okay and sparked the following experiment for a most sustainable recipe.

I found RecipeTinEats' cookies could be a bit too soft. Replacing some of the flour with cocoa seems to "harden" them a bit. Not to mention the additional chocolate flavour.

## Ingredients

- 1.25 cups plain flour
- 0.5 cup of cocoa powder
- 1 tsp baking soda 
- pinch of salt
- 175g unsalted butter
- 0.5 cup brown sugar
- 0.5 cup white sugar
- 1 egg
- 1 egg yolk 
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 cup chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Whisk flour, cocoa, salt, baking soda in a bowl.

    Possibly sieve the flour/cocoa.

2. Melt the butter in the microwave using 25 sec intervals.
3. Whisk to finish melting the butter
4. Add the butter to the combined sugars and whisk/stir well (at least 15 secs)
5. Add egg, egg yolk and vanilla to the butter/sugar and whisk.
6. Add the flour/cocoa mix to the wet ingredients and stir until just combined.
7. Add the chocolate chips and stir to combine - let stand for at least 5 minutes.
8. Preheat oven to 180C (350F)
9. Line baking trays with baking paper.
10. Use a spoon to scoop out cookie dough and place on the baking tray - leave space
