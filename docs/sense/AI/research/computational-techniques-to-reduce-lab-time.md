!!! note "ðŸš§  Under renovation"


Computational techniques have been used to accelerate material innovation by reducing lab time.


## Methods

- Monte Carlo simulations to quantify uncertainties 
- reinforcement learning to iteratively refine blend predictions from experimental data, 

Amin et al (2023) describe 

- Multi-expression programming (MEP) and gene expression programming (GEP) - both examples of genetic programming
