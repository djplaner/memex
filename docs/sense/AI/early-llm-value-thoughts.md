title: Early LLMm value thoughts
---


See: [[AI]]

The [Google "moat" document](https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither) suggests that Google and OpenAI don't have a competitive advantage.  That open source is eating any advantage. What is the advantage/value of LLMs?

Early thoughts are that the key value of LLMs is their ability to weave together different sources of information/knowledge (a form of epistemic fluency). The current state of play is focused on people figuring out how they can leverage this for specific use cases. My current use case is formal education, predominantly higher education. What's the advantage/value of LLMs in this context?  

If the challenge in higher education is the sharing of the disparate knowledge required, is this where LLMs can help? How?
