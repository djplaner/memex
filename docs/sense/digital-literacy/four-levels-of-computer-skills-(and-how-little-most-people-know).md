# Four levels of computer skills (and how little most people know)

> The OECD, a club of mostly rich nations, recently published a survey on adult skills, which captures information on proficiency in literacy, numeracy and computer skills.
> Almost a quarter (24.3%) of the people in the study don’t know how to use one. Ten per cent had never used a computer, so took a paper-based test.
> Almost another 10% (9.6%) refused to take the computer test at all, preferring to take the paper-based assessment. That’s despite saying they had used a computer before.
> Almost 5% (4.7%) of adults failed the basic test, which included using a mouse or scrolling through a web page. [source](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/02/a-quarter-of-adults-can-t-use-a-computer?utm_content=buffer21385&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer)
