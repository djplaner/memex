Bell, A. R., & Brooks, C. (2019). Is There a 'Magic Link' Between Research Activity, Professional Teaching Qualifications and Student Satisfaction? *Higher Education Policy*, *32*(2), 227--248\. <https://doi.org/10.1057/s41307-018-0081-0>

## Area of inquiry

Student satisfaction and its determinants

## Research questions

## Methodology

Systematic quantiative study of drivers of student satisfaction.

Quantiative analysis of NSS data - particularly quality satisfcation question. Combined with demographic data on teaching staff from another source. But the two data sets are organised differnetly. And also research data.



## Findings

## Practical Recommendations

## Weaknesses and limitations


## Relationship to other research

Satisfaction and teaching qualifications

- Universities keen to maximise student satisfaction for various reasons
- somewhat limited research on student satisfaction in the UK - references given
- survey of students reveal 39% rating "formal training to teach" as key characteristic versus 17% research involvement - and other survey results
- growing requirements for tertiary teachers to have formal qualifications
- Layton and Brown (2011) argue that such moves are simplisitic and neoliberal
- Thornton (2014) sees formal teaching quals as key to enhancing the student experience

Satisfaction versus outcomes and impact on practice

- This paper finds no connection with student satisfaction
- Cites papers that explore impact on learner outcomes and teacher practice (Thornton, 2012; Trigwell, 2013; Parsons et al 2012; Gibbs and Coffery, 2004) which show
- academics benefit personally
- students have learning gains as a result of the resultant learning experience


## Further research

- obtaining a formal qual may be example of self selecting, only those that are keen do it.
- Qualitiative research (smaller scale) examining the changes brought about by formal quals might be useful.
