# Explorations in Foam development

See also: [[web-development]], [[possible-foam-svelte]]

[Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) is the tool underpinning my processes of knowledge management on this site. The purpose here is to explore if and how I might enhance/transform how I do that using Svelte/SvelteKit. Hopefully fulfilling two aims

1. Refine my knowledge management practices.
2. Refine my Svelte/SvelteKit dev knowledge.

## Broad steps

1. [[sveltekit-github-pages]] - get a SvelteKit app deployed to Github pages.
2. Use that approach to publish a Foam site.
3. Refine my use of Foam through features from Svelte and/or within Foam itself????
