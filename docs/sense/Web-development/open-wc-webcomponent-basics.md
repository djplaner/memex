Working through [this CodeLab](https://open-wc.org/codelabs/basics/web-components.html?index=/codelabs/#0)

## Defining web components

Start with a definition of [[web-components]]

## Custom elements

The method by which use and define a web components

Use by definining a new tag e.g. ```<cool-element></cool-element>```. **Question** It seems all lower case with dashes for spaces is the naming approach.

Define by creating a class that extends ```HTMLElement``` class and use ```customeElements.define``` to connect the class and the tag.

## Customising our element

The custom element inherits all the standard HTML element properties, methods (e.g. event listeners)

There are associate lifecyle callbacks

- ```connectedCallback``` - when the element is connected to the page, including with drag & drop operations
- ```disconnectedCallback``` - the opposite

## Templating

Browser provides a ```<template>``` element to enable definition and efficient cloning of HTML. lit-html and lit-element are high level methods for using this.

## Shadow DOM

Method of encapsulating what happens within web component elements. What's inside doesn't leak in or out to the DOM.
