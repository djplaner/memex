Figuring out good methods - and choosing one to use in [[canvas-collections]] - for making REST API requests from a web application.

Possible resources

- [API Client patterns](https://medium.com/js-dojo/api-client-patterns-every-front-end-developer-need-to-know-b0957e05b134) - medium article, may be useful
- [axios library tutorial](https://dev.to/bajcmartinez/how-to-master-http-requests-with-axios-1b3l) - seems a common alternative to other methods, including an abort controller

## Exploration 1 - API Client patterns (with Axios)

Couldn't use dummyapi so trying with jsonplaceholder. To work through [this tutorial](https://medium.com/js-dojo/api-client-patterns-every-front-end-developer-need-to-know-b0957e05b134)

Moved to use [MockAPI](https://app.wiremock.cloud/) as it provides more configuration options

### Pure asynchronous call

Making a single call to the API

Two versions 

1. A straight call from the tutorial

    - Returns almost straight away and continues with operation 
2. Using async/await

    - Works basically the same, but much cleaner

### Orchestration

Need to make several different calls in a sequence or parallel

The model here is to use the `await` keyword and just implement them sequentially

The default implementation is simply a sequence of `await` calls.  Any of which may fail raising issues of how to deal with progressive failure/progress.
