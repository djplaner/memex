# SvelteKit and Github pages 



!!! warning "Deprecated"

  The long forgotten intent to use Svelte has been replaced by a focus on Python and static site generation using MkDocs. See [[foam-dev]] for more.

> **Current status:** "pretend" blog from SvelteKit documentation is working on local dev. However, publishing to github not working.  The about and blog pages aren't working

## Experiment #1 - Simple combination

Using [these instructions](https://github.com/shinokada/sveltekit-githubpages) to work with [this repo](https://github.com/djplaner/svelte-ghpages-test)

Basic setup process

1. Set up SvelteKit project using standard process
2. Add the static adapter - way to generate static files from SvelteKit - specific to gh-pages

	Note: need to remove the existing adapter import
3. Modify the projects config file to use the static adapter
4. Modify the layout
5. Modify the package.json

To deploy `npm run gh-pages` based on changes to package.json

The original repo used `routes/+page.svelte` as the static content that was created

And that works.

## Experiment #2 - Learn a bit more about SvelteKit

Working through the [svelte tutorial](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/pages)

### Basic SvelteKit

- ??must be named `+page.svelte`?? Svelte files in `src/routes` define the pages/URLs for the app
- `+layout.svelte` defines common layout for all sibling and child pages
- use folder names surrounded by square brackets to define dynamic parameters 
- [three tasks for SvelteKit](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/page-data)
  1. Routing - which route matches the request
  2. Loading - get the data needed by the route
     - each page can define a `load` function to get the data - defining title and slug `+page.server.js`
  	 - use `setHeaders` to set response headers
  	 - use `cookies`
     - same with layouts `+layout.server.js`
     - `src/lib` can be used for common code
  3. Rendering - generate some HTML to match 

### Static site generation

[`adapter-static` documentation](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-static) and [github pages specifics](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-static#github-pages) which adds more steps

1. Update `paths.base` to match repo name
2. add the `.nojeckyll` file to the static folder
3. More detail in `svelte.config.js`
