## About

[Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) is a key tool used to maintain this site. Much of the design thinking and implementation of this site is covered in the [[colophon|About page]]. This page now documents experiments with various technologies that might be used with Foam/Mkdocs.

!!! note "Original purpose - Svelte" 

    Originally this section's purpose was 
    
        ...to explore if and how I might enhance/transform how I do that using Svelte/SvelteKit. Hopefully fulfilling two aims

    I've since lost my Svelte "fetish" and focusing more now on Python and static site generation using MkDocs.

    FWIW, early steps with Svelte started with [[sveltekit-github-pages]]

## Evolving thinking

Foam is increasingly looking like being primarily an authoring tool with some local preview and some in-built ability to publish a static site. It is used in many different ways, some for which local preview is sufficient. If - like me - you're wanting a more sophisticated website as the result of using Foam, then you need to spend a fair bit of work with a static site generator (Gatsby, MkDocs etc). People will use different SSGs.

There's a tradeoff in the complexity of Foam functionality and the flexibility to use a variety of external tools. Perhaps Foam functinality should

1. Focus on authoring and local preview, and
2. Support a variety of SSGs for publishing.

This appears to align with the ["Foam helps you share your thoughts"](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/principles#foam-helps-you-share-your-thoughts-with-the-world) principle. Also the ["Foam enables you to do your best thinking"](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/principles#foam-enables-you-to-do-your-best-thinking) principle that includes the points: Foam is a starting point and many others.

## Foam's conceptual model

@jevakillio (2020) "There is no one Foam Method". Foam offers partial support for the Zettelkasten method, but isn't prescriptive.

### Relationship between tags and wikilinks?

Early discussion (2020) has people using wikilinks, not so much tags.
