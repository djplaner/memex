## About

[Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) is a key tool used to maintain this site. Much of the design thinking and implementation of this site is covered in the [[colophon|About page]]. This page now documents experiments with various technologies that might be used with Foam/Mkdocs.

!!! note "Original purpose - Svelte" 

    Originally this section's purpose was 
    
        ...to explore if and how I might enhance/transform how I do that using Svelte/SvelteKit. Hopefully fulfilling two aims

    I've since lost my Svelte "fetish" and focusing more now on Python and static site generation using MkDocs.

    FWIW, early steps with Svelte started with [[sveltekit-github-pages]]

## Foam's conceptual model

@jevakillio (2020) "There is no one Foam Method". Foam offers partial support for the Zettelkasten method, but isn't prescriptive.

### Relationship between tags and wikilinks?

Early discussion (2020) has people using wikilinks, not so much tags.
