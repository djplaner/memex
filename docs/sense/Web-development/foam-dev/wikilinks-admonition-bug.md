!!! Question "A bug that I might report and work to solve?"

    Wondering if this is a bug that could give me my start with contributing to the Foam codebase?

## Description

Wikilinks are sometimes not being recognised (i.e. change in text-color and addition to the wikilinks definition at bottom of page) when that are included in a paragraph that is indented. My most common usage is in a [Material for MkDocs admonition](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/admonitions/?h=admon#usage).

## Possible example

!!! note "Example of wikilinks bug"

    The main body of admonition is indented. For example, [[pkm]]. Or perhaps [[seek]]

But if the same wikilink is added to a para that isn't indented e.g. [[seek]]. It will be added to the wikilinks definition at the bottom of the page. The text colour for the wikilink that is not in the indented paragraph will also change.

## Exploration

Questions

- What other existing discussions of similar problems (wikilinks) are there?
- Is wikilinks a core feature of Foam? Or a plugin?
