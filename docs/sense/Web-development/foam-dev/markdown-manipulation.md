Exploring methods for retrieving, analysing, and manipulating large collections of Markdown files (using Python).

In particular, approaches that might support something like [Obsidian dataview](https://astro-digital-garden.stereobooster.com/recipes/obsidian-dataview/)


## Related tools

- [mrkdwn_analysis](https://pypi.org/project/markdown-analysis/)

    Python module which parses Markdown files into component parts and provides methods for analysis. Fairly active.

- [MarkdownDB](https://markdowndb.com/#features)

    Javascript database, probably can't use due to too heavy weight. Uses SQLite. Too much functionality for this need.

- [Osbidian Dataview](https://astro-digital-garden.stereobooster.com/recipes/obsidian-dataview/) and similar [remark dataview](https://github.com/stereobooster/braindb/tree/main/packages/remark-dataview)

    A dataview query language that can be embedded in Markdown files and used to query metadata etc from Markdown notes. Makes data aggregation easy.

    See also [markdown-queries](https://github.com/dstengle/markdown-queries), an attempt to bring Obsidian dataview into the VSCode.

## "MarkdownDB" like functionality

- `build.sh` parses Markdown files into a SQLite database before running mkdocs.
- Uses git to only update changes
- [[computational-components]] can then use the SQLite database for various purposes
