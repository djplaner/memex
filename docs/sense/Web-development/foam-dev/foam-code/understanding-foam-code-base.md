title: Understanding the Foam Code Base
type: note

Combining the [VSCode extension documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/api) with the [Foam source code](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) to gain some understanding of how VSCode extensions/Foam work.

## Questions to answer

### Where is the logger info displayed/saved

Menu View/Output and then select Foam from the drop down. Displays the output of the logger


## Developing conceptual map

The presence of `foam.json` in a VS Code workspace activates Foam. The various event "handlers" are set up during activation.

`src/features/index.tx` defines an array `FoamFeatures` in turn used to set up promises for the various features.

Each of Foam's features are setup as "event handlers" that are called when the relevant event occurs. Activation essentially sets up any basic utility objects and then sets up the event handlers for the various features.
