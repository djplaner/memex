title: Moving to Third Age development
---
The Card and Content Interface are extended copies of the of [the original Blackboard Tweaks code](https://tweaks.github.io/Tweaks/index.html). Code released in 2011. Even though it's a bit late, it could be labelled part of the first age of Javascript (see [[third-age-of-javascript]]) given its reliance on jQuery and approach to build (i.e. nothing). My extension into the Card and Content Interface is that of a novice learning.  Time to move to something more contemporary.

Aim is to move the Card and Content Interface "seamlessly" into web components and [[third-age-of-javascript]] to enable quicker and more responsive feature development. In particular, the ability to build out a design system of learning activities based on Web components.

Plan is

- [ ] Move Card-Interface-Tweak into a 2nd generation build process (Webpack)
- [ ] Move the Content-Interface-Tweak into the same 
- [ ] Restructure the code of both to use [ES Modules](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/03/es-modules-a-cartoon-deep-dive/)

## Move the Card-Interface-Tweak

### [Identified process](https://www.sitepoint.com/es6-babel-webpack/)
