The [new tutorial](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics) for Svelte 3. Interactive.

## Components

A Svelte application is composed from one or more components. A component encapsulated HTML, CSS and JS in a `.svelte` file. It can be one or more of these.

2. JS - JS wrapped in a `<script>` tag
1. HTML - mark up apparently not wrapped with anything

    - Can embed and execute JS using braces
	- HTML attributes can be set with " but also if named correct `<img {src}>`
	- `{@html }` tells Svelte to insert HTML into the DOM (by default treated as string)
	- `(#if )` and `():else)` are used for conditional rendering (where the round brackets in those statements should be curly braces - _kludge_ to prevent mkdocs parsing error)
3. CSS - CSS wrapped in `<style>` tag

Components can be imported and used as tags

## Code structure


## Building

[Svelte for new developers](https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-for-new-developers)

Vite and the vite-plugin-svelte is recommended build tool. [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) is the under development application framework from the Svelte team.

```npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template svelte```

## Reactivity

- Reactivity is triggered by assignment statements
- Variables displayed in HTML are auto updated as JS changes values
- To chain variables (i.e. have a 2nd variable also update based on changes in first) precede any linkage with ```$:```
- ```$:``` can be wraped around JS code so it is run reactively

## Sharing state between components

- Internal state - values only accessible within the component
- **properties** are declared to pass data to a component's children
- These can be set as an attribute in the component tag
- object of properties can [be spread](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/spread-props)
