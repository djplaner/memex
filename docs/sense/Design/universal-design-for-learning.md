title: Universal Design for Learning

## Does it improve learning outcomes? Is that the right question? 

[Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/steph_moore/status/1661010641380065282) covering some of this.  Main points 

- Think of it more of a design philosophy, rather than a theory of how learning happens 
- Perhaps a better question is _Does UDL actually remove systemic barriers?_
- Also makes the point that designers "inscribe values and ethics" into their designs and UDL may be useful as a design philosophy or project framing

There is something there. Especially given most calls for adoption of UDL at the institutional level aim to encourage teaching staff to adopt UDL practices on top of everything else they're doing
