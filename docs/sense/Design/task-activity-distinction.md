title: The distinction between task and activity

My current take

- Task - a description/prescription of what must be done
- Activity - the actual work that is being done

Goodyear and company have the task situated in an epistemic space.

## Goodyear and Wisner and others

[[goodyear-tasks-activities-and-student-learning]] draws on Wisner (1995)

> An essential concept is clearly shown here: the difference between the prescribed work (the task) and the real work (the activity) linked to the concrete difficulties of the situation, to their perception by the operator, to the strategies (s)he adopts to satisfy the demands of the work and, in particular, to the hazards. As Dejours (1993) wrote, one cannot avoid considering the creative aspect of any work activity.  This is an intelligence of practice, a ‘metis', the crafty intelligence already distinguisohed in ancient Greek vocabulary. (Wisner, 1995a, 597) 

> The plans are the instructions, the task and the work prescribed and the situated action is the real work.” (Wisner, 1995b, 1549)

> Situated activity as a ‘meshwork’ of people and things, brought together in processes of co- configuration (Sun & Goodyear, 2019)
