> The more something is tailored for the particular likes, dislikes, skills, and needs of a particular target population, the less likely it will be appropriate for others.

Perhaps a link/need here for enabling co-configuration.

Origins in activity theory
> It is a high-level view of tasks and goals and clearly does not focus on “the user” as an individual unit. Instead, it gives us a framework in which to consider what people do, or what we want them to be able to do, in a more-or-less general sense. This can be a very attractive perspective to take in situations where the user-base is very diverse, the goals are varied, but the broad activities are less numerous and easier to define.

Positions ACD as a wider angle lens (a different lens) than HCD.

Offers simplified version of Engstrom's diagram

Mentions issues with personas being good for generating empathy but tending to become "too general to represent any real-life customer"

 Wonder how Goodyear positions ACAD against Engstroms activity systems ideas

 [Don Norman]() argues that human-centered design has some limtiations and that activity-centered design is a better option. Following is an ad hoc summary of his thinking.

## Logic versus usage: The case for activity-centered design

[blog post](https://jnd.org/logic_versus_usage_the_case_for_activity-centered_design/) originally published as Norman (2006)

As the title suggests it argues that how organisations (and perhaps professions) are organised, operate and think "are too logical, too rational". In a way that doesn't gel with human behaviour.

Cites evidence from anthropology about how blacksmiths and carpenters organise their tools during usage.  Janet Dougherty and Charles Keller call this organisational logic _taskonomy_

Norman suggests that human-centered design techniques lead to _"hardware store" organisation. Where hammers are in the hammers section, and nails in the nails section. He labels this _taxonomy_

Appropriate for libraries and stores **"where the major problem is locating the desired item out of context"**. Norman does point out that some stores have figured this out and "put potato chips and pretzels next to the beer"

He then compares reviews of various mobile phones contrasting taskonomy versus taxonomy design approaches.
