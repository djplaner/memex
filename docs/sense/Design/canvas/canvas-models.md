Attempt to distill the models that underpin Canvas

- [UTS' glossary of Canvas terms](https://lx.uts.edu.au/collections/planning-your-canvas-course/resources/glossary-of-canvas-terms/)
- [[training-communication]]
- [[authoring-tools]]

## Canvas limitations/concerns

- Rich Text Editor (RTE) configuration 
    - Currently removes all Javascript, non-standard HTML (e.g. web components) and "advanced" CSS (inline or not)
- Javascript can be added at admin/account level (i.e. IT department) - will they?
- Will we have access to the Canvas REST  and other APIs

## Misc notes

- Canvas does not have folders - uses Modules and Pages to organise content and assessments
- Rich Text Editor strips Javascript - ??workaround??

## [Thinking in Canvas](https://educational-innovation.sydney.edu.au/teaching@sydney/thinking-in-canvas/) Danny Liu's intro from USyd

- pages
    -  primary way to provide content 
    -  has version control
    -  permissions on pages is flexible e.g. students can be given edit access
    -  pages are used to embed all things, including Canvas features???

- modules - as the new organiser
    - replacement for folders
    - provide a linear pathway through a unit 
    - also provide the conditional release ability

## Modules

Intended to make organisation and navigation easier [source](https://sites.rmit.edu.au/sister/2020/06/29/designing-a-module-in-canvas/). A focus on creating flow.

## Templates

Canvas has the ["Ready-Made Template" suite](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Instructional-Designer/2020-Course-Design-Essentials-Ready-Made-Template-Refresh/td-p/278763)
> help reduce stress load, encourage growth and help course creators design an engaging Canvas experience by turning a blank course shell into a fill-in-the-blank Canvas course.

- [Three approaches to creating a Canvas template](https://www.unicon.net/insights/articles/three-approaches-to-creating-a-canvas-template)
- e.g. [USyd](https://lx.uts.edu.au/collections/examples-canvas-sites/resources/how-can-i-structure-my-canvas-subject-site-effectively/) provides templates for pages in Canvas

### Canvas Model

1. Canvas may provide a suggested template with one criterion and three achievement levels.
2. Add as many criteria (rows) and levels of achievement (columns) as you need
3. Choose the standards: letter grades, numerical scale, terminology
4. Rubrics display in three different locations for Canvas activities: 

    - assignments - `+ Rubric` button at bottom
    - quizzes - via the pizza menu 
    - discussions - via the pizza menu
5.  Optional settings

    - Use free-form comments when assessing students

        Use comments instead of ratings scale. Comments can be reused for multiple submissions. But can't give partial credit. Use this with the "use rubric for grading" option
    - use this rubric for assignment grading
    - Hide score total for assessment results

        Used for formative feedback.  Hide the total score when they view the rubric


## Work arounds

- Apparently embedding web pages from a secure server is one workaround [source](https://wordpress.miracosta.edu/joyfulteaching/2017/07/22/lisas-dozen-tips-for-canvas/)
- [Embedding javascript](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Question-Forum/How-do-I-add-javascript-in-the-HTML-editor/m-p/120884/highlight/true#M41789) - Laura's published workaround.  JS and call to JS in a page, included in an iframe
