## Inbox vs Announcements

Often compared, but not competitors

- Inbox forwards messages to real individual email folder

InBox/Conversations is almost a mailing list. Allows students to reply.

- groupings of students? by section/tutorial/group
- replies could be interesting
- doesn't appear that students can reply to the entire recipient list?
