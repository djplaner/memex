## Rubrics

- [Community discussion importing Blackboard rubrics](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/LMS-Migration-Strategies/Blackboard-rubrics-imported-into-Canvas/ba-p/106640)

  - [Descriptive experience](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/LMS-Migration-Strategies/Blackboard-rubrics-imported-into-Canvas/bc-p/106649/highlight/true#M151) - "might as well just build the Rubric in Canvas from scratch"
  - [Workaround import](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/LMS-Migration-Strategies/Blackboard-rubrics-imported-into-Canvas/bc-p/106650/highlight/true#M152) - edit Bb rubrics to be points-based (not % or range), reverse the order of point values (0 points set to highest vice-versa - the text will not match the points), export/import, edit the point values
