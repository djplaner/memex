Summary of training session with Instructor - "Creating Learning Paths"

## What are learning paths? (aka Mastery paths?)

Apparently an approach to "personalised learning" or adaptive release. [Common language](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-use-MasteryPaths-in-course-modules/ta-p/906) appears to be "customize learning experience for students based on performance"

## Why use them?

## IDEAS and experiments

- Javascript way of repurposing the interface for modules to use accordions or similar
  - Current Module interface is next page / separate pages
- Using the workaround of emojis as prefix to module/object names to identify type 
- Also combining that with "text headers" added into the module
- User script to add all items in a module as a requirement - but also example of how these types of interfaces work well for one item, but fail at lots of items - would need to be using the API rather than scraping the interface
- Home page
  - Create a page that includes Javascript etc. (onlinecrsldy)
  - Set it as the home page
  - Use Javascript and the API to build Card interface (using Modules)

## Module capabilities and reflection

reflection
- adding a page we end up in pages, have to navigate back to modules
- new additions to modules aren't automatically published, also the module needs to be ticked
- the changing of the breadcrumbs within modules is a problem, breaks the standard assumption of how the web should work

Capabilities
- indentation to 3 levels
- ability to drag and drop sections between different modules

Module locks, requirements and pre-requisites
- Locks prevent students viewing ?? before date/time
- pre-requisites something has to happen before you can see
- requirement - what a students is required to do to complete

- Also a place to integrate 

- All Canvas content and other files etc can be added into Modules
- Apply pre-reqs and requirements

#### Activity 1

1. Create a module
2. Add 3 bits of content
3. Re-order items

### Activity 2 - managing content

1.
