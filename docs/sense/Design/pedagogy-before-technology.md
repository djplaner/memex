# Pedagogy before technology 

See also: [[design]], [[entangled-pedagogy]]

Numerous authors (Ascough, 2002; Leijen et al, 2008; Glover et al, 2016; Cowling & Birt, 2018; Sankey et al, 2020) suggest that thinking of the "pedagogy before the technology" is a good approach to designing learning and teaching experiences.

aka 

- Put the pedagogy horse before the technology cart 
- pedagogy is the driver and technology is the accelerator (Tsui and Tavares, 2021)


# Challenges

Other work challenges this idea (Dron, 2012; Tsui & Tavares, 2021; Fawns, 2022).

## Play with your materials

The following is from a book (Fleer, 2023) intended to help school teachers teaching the Technologies learning area from the Oz curriculum. It is a poster a teacher had on her wall explaining a production processes used in her class.

The first step in this process is to "collaboratively play (investigate) with the materials". I take this as playing with a technology to understand its affordances and constraints. If you design without having such an understanding your ultimate design will be constrained.
