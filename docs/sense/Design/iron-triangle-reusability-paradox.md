title: Links between Iron Triangle and the Reusability Paradox

Explore the idea that the [[iron-triangle]] and [[reusability-paradox]] cover some of the same ground i.e. that there is some link between them. e.g. the reason people wish to reduce context and become more general is to increase scale/scope.  But by moving that you inextricably move the other.

**Question:** Could their be a dynamic Javascript chart that includes scale/context and ?cost? or some other dimension? Could the iron triangle be represented as a chart (or three)
