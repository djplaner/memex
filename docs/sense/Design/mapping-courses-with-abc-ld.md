title: Mapping courses with ABC LD
---
Is it possible to map an existing course and its activities using ABC LD?

i.e. could an existing course be abstracted to a collection of and sequence of certain activities. Activities abstracted enough to allow analysis and translation?

## Possible process/

1. Work through course and its activities
    Remembering that activities can draw on multiple activity types
2. Categorise activities against learning types and create a new example(s)
3. Use categories on StoryBoard to keep track.

## Examples
### [Excel](https://www.inclusiveweb.net/abc-learning-design/abc-ld-online-in-excel/)

Provides an [Excel spreadsheet](https://www.inclusiveweb.net/online-abc-ld-v3/) with the following sheets
- 0 Learning type activities - define the types and examples - used in drop downs
- i Definitions - defines the learning types
- Licence and version - as on the label 
- i Instructions - 
- 8 Actions - a to do list
- 1 & 7 Tweet and ILOs - about the course and learning outcomes
- 2 & 6 Shape - overview of the course and activities
- 8 Blend - showing how much online and f-t-f - not sure it's useful
- 4-op1 Storyboard - list of activity titles and types - uses drop downs from _0 Learning type activities_
- 4-op2 Learning Designer Export

## [Web-based application](https://educational-innovation.sydney.edu.au/abc/)

USyd has a web application that appears to scaffold it. [More details (march 2021)](https://educational-innovation.sydney.edu.au/teaching@sydney/doing-learning-design-for-online-while-online/).  An evolution of ABC moving online.

Features

- Uses a "card-based" interface to populate activities - echoing LAMS in someway
- Has an inbuilt analysis feature (types of learning activities)
- data is available as a JSON object that could be re-used.
- Written with a Cold Fusion backend.  jQuery on the front end.

Completed example of a highly visual collaborative and online artefact arising from a ABC LD process.  More useful perhaps from a design perspective than the USyd application, but misses out on the computational support (e.g. analysis of learning activity types)
