Pondering the relationship between ABC Learning Design and ACAD.  

## Current thoughts

ACAD is "an approach to understanding and improving complex learning situations" (Goodyear et al, 2021, p. 445)

ABC Learning Design is a rapid design process (collaborative and face-to-face originally) for designing the weekly sequence/collection of learning activities for a course.

ABC Learning Design uses Laurillard's learning activity types as an abstract representation with one of the common extensions being to suggest specific implementation types - these could be usefully captured/leveraged using ACAD

limitations

- Neither explicitly deal with the challenge of adopting a more [[forward-oriented-design]] approach.
- Nor do they provide explicit support for sharing/abstracting designs across a program - both do support sharing of artefacts, but not necessarily doing
