Images of a 45-storey building in Guiyang China say something about generative building blocks and default course sites. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/UrbanFoxxxx/status/1397535888339607555) and [original](https://jordhammond.com/products/print-china)

Especially brings into question the "consistency, not sameness" argument from some.

Possible links to the patterns guy's keynote talk at OOPSLA (can't remember his name) and point about a standardised suburb built in post-war USA.

Someone linked to [highrise of homes](https://www.siteenvirodesign.com/content/high-rise-homes) theoretical project from 1981
