### How to add

1. Using LaTeX code between _double dollar sign_ delimeters **$$** - creates a new indented paragraph for the mathematics
2. Using inline **\( \)** delimiters for the formulas to be inline.
2. Using the [Canvas Maths Editor](https://lx.uts.edu.au/collections/building-your-canvas-course/resources/canvas-math-editor/#maths_editor) via RCE

Maths Editor is a plugin available via the RCE. Stores data in LaTeX format - Canvas uses [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) to convert on the fly.  You can also enter LaTeX directly.

Works in new quiz for MCQ. What about other question types?
