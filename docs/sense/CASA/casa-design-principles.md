# Design principles for Context-Appropriate Scaffolding Assemblages (CASA)

([Jones, 2019](https://djon.es/blog/2019/08/08/exploring-knowledge-reuse-in-design-for-digital-learning-tweaks-h5p-constructive-templates-and-casa/#designPrinciples))

- Contextually-Appropriate
  1. A CASA should address a specific *contextual* need within a specific *activity*.
  2. CASA should be built using and generate *generative technologies*.
  3. CASA development should be *strategically aligned* and supported.
- Scaffolding
  4. CASA should package appropriate design knowledge to enable (re-)use by teachers and students.
  5. CASA should actively support a *forward-oriented* approach to design for learning.
- Assemblages
  6. CASA are conceptualised and treated as contextual *assemblages*
