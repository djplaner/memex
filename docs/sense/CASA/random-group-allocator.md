Explorations to develop a web page based (Javascript) method for randomly allocating groups by 

- Copy and pasting a collection of student names;
- Setting group size; and 
- visibly displaying the group allocation.

[Repo complete](https://github.com/djplaner/GroupGenerator) and [deployed via GitHub Pages](https://djplaner.github.io/GroupGenerator/).

## [GroupGenerator](https://github.com/togarci/GroupGenerator)

Plan to adapt this one

- Translate to English
- Replace manual addition of names with text area

### Implementation details

- `addName` called on button press - to be removed
- `generateGroup` does the work
- `updateCurrentAllocation` - add a feature that shows a calculation of the number of groups as names are added
