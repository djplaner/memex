title: Word to Canvas
---

[Word to Canvas](https://djplaner.github.io/word-to-canvas-module/) is a userscript designed to enable authored Word documents to be converted into Canvas modules.

Developed early in the migration of Griffith University from Blackboard to Canvas. Largely used to significantly reduce the conceptual dissonance between the two systems that would require significant manual work to overcome.
