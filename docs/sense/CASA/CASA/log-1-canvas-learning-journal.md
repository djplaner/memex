## Designing a Learning Journal CASA for Canvas

Automate the process of setting up a learning journal that

1. Creates a group set for the journal.
2. Creates a group for each student in the Courses.

  - e.g. [done with CSV import](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-import-groups-in-a-group-set/ta-p/417799)
3. Set up each group's site as per learning design.

    Each Canvas group site can have announcements, pages, discussion topics (most Canvas objects) that are specific to the group. This is how to scaffold the specifics of the learning journal in Canvas. 

4. Track and manage student engagement.
5. Mark assessment related components.


## Questions

Group creation/maintenance

- [ ] How difficult is this via the CSV import? Problems with 1 person groups?

    [Process](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-import-groups-in-a-group-set/ta-p/417799)

    - Create the group set first, use _I'll create groups later_ switch
    - Use the import button - which apparently generates a CSV file to download

        - Does provide a link to the _Group Categories Import API_
    - Edit the CSV by updating the _group_name_ column appropriately
    - Upload

- [ ] What happens as students added to/removed from the course? 
- [ ] Can it be automated? API? How?

Group site set up

- [ ] How difficult to set up manually? Does Canvas provide a way to pre-populate groups?

    - With discussions, you set a switch _this is a group discussion_ and one is created for each group in a group set.
    - With pages, it is done via the group navigation (i.e. in the group)
- [ ] How to automate population of Canvas groups? API? other means?

    - [Groups API](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/groups.html) enables uploading of a file and a lot of querying of group resources (including activity steam). But apparently a group can be used as _parent context_ for other resource types e.g. rather than `/v1/courses/{course_id}/pages` (create page for a course) use `/v1/groups/{group_id}/pages` to create a page for  group.

## Sample course design

Course design that includes

- weekly learning activity log

    1 post per week. Fixed format (one of two to choose from)
- portfolio 1

    - Collection of weekly tasks. Combined into a single Word document.  
    - A reflection
    - Feedback
- portfolio 2
