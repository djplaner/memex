# Log 3 - Canvas learning journal

Implementation of a [[canvas-learning-journal]] [[casa]].

In particular, the aim here is to develop a web-based report on activity/contributions to an individual group graded discussion.


- [X] [Search for example graded discussion forum reports](#search-for-example-graded-discussion-forum-reports) - nothing apparent for the current purpose
- [ ] Design the visuals for such a report
- [ ] [What APIs required - REST/GraphQL](#what-apis-required---restgraphql)
- [ ] Implement in Python

## Search for example graded discussion forum reports


- [Workshop presentation](https://www.uv.uio.no/om/organisasjon/idea/aktivitetstilbud/idea-arrangerer/uv-labene/engagelab-using-canvas-discussion-analytics-for-teaching-and-online-discussion) from Norway on PhD student developing a Canvas discussions dashboard - not a great amount of detail

### Canvas LMS discussions to Google analytics

[post](https://hawksey.info/blog/2016/04/pushing-canvas-lms-discussion-data-to-google-analytics-tips-on-google-analytics-api-integration-batch-collection-and-queue-time/) from Martin Hawksey. And [related earlier post](https://hawksey.info/blog/2013/02/lak13-recipes-in-capturing-and-analyzing-data-using-sna-on-canvas-discussions-with-nodexl-for-when-its-not-a-snapp/) useing NodeJS

Interesting application, slightly different purpose

### [Discussion Analytics](http://learningapps.northwestern.edu/#/app/c92eafed-61bd-4261-8ce0-470910a34e69)

PHP App from Northwestern University - applies NLP to content from discussion forums. [Code is available](https://bitbucket.org/northwesternitartsdg/discussion-analytics-release/src/master/)

Different purpose

## What APIS required - REST/GraphQL

### [Discussion Topics API](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/discussion_topics.html)

Can be given group id


Likely process

- Configuration information required
  - groupset to focus on
  - name of graded discussion topic?

- Get a list of the groups from the group set
- For each group
    - List the [discusion topics](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/discussion_topics.html#method.discussion_topics.index)
    - if the right one 
      - [Get the full topic](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/discussion_topics.html#method.discussion_topics_api.view)
    - Get [the user profile](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/users.html#method.profile.settings) for the student in the group
