# H-A-X as CASA? 



## Introduction 

[Bryan Ollendyke's (btopro)](https://github.com/btopro) project [HAX](https://haxtheweb.org/) provides a very advanced and interesting approach that might be a great example for implementing [[casa]]. Is it?

Todo 

- Follow up on the idea of multiple purposes - refine the CASA purpose(s) and explore

### Strengths 

### Challenges

As [OLDaily notes](https://www.downes.ca/post/75304) there are challenges getting your head around the project. Perhaps because there are many different purposes people may put it to. It's certainly a challenge I've struggled with.


## Experimentation

In [this blog post](https://djon.es/blog/2020/08/01/pondering-if-and-how-hax-web-components-fit-in-blackboard/) I report on early experiments (2020) exploring if/how HAX might be used within Blackboard learn. In 2023, I've just updated the post by including a HAX component into the Wordpress post.  Achieved by 

1. Add a Wordpress plugin that enables the addition of custom Javascript to a Wordpress site. 
2. Use that plugin to includ the [HAX magic script](https://dev.to/btopro/uwc-part-3-the-magic-script-122a) (two script tags) into my Wordpress site. 
3. Use the [meme-maker HAX component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lrnwebcomponents/meme-maker) to add a specific meme. (One of some [290 available components](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40lrnwebcomponents))
