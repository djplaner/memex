Finalising requirements and design for a [[canvas-learning-journal]] CASA. A method to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the single student group kludge for implementing a learning journal in Canvas.

Basic model is some code (Python script) that is run daily (early hours of the morning). It uses a configuration file to

1. Create and update group membership
2. Create discussion forums for each task
3. Generate a web page giving overview of student contributions and marking.

## Requirements

Teachers attempting to use the single person group kludge report additional workload and errors.


- Automated creation

    - Students - regardless of when they are enrolled in the course - have a group created for them.
    - Support for different section-based group sets.

- Timely feedback

    - Notification of when students post. 
    - Ways to organise by date posted to prioritise response.

- Identifying/remembering students

    - Photos etc to connect student response with face-to-face interactions.

- Support a variety of task regimes

    A task regime is how many and what reflective tasks students are writing about

    - Open - whatever students like
    - Specified - a specific number tasks with specific requirements
    - Regular - e.g. a task each week, unspecified

- Support a variety of marking regimes

    - Holistic mark for all
    - Mark per task

## Design

Different functionality required

1. Create and update group sets, groups and membership
2. Create the discussion forums for the tasks
3. Track who has/hasn't contributed and details of marking
4. Mark contributions

### Create and update of groupsets, groups and membership

Provide 

- Name of group set to create
- List of sections to include in creating groups

    Would likely require additional coding to focus on a section. Maybe the CSV file download includes sections - probably not.
- Naming scheme for groups (student name, number etc)

With this information ensure that all of the students in the specified sections have groups created for them.

## Create discussion forums

Provide

- Number of tasks
- For each task
    - Name of task
    - HTML (Canvas page) for task description
    - Points possible
    - Due date
    - Allow threaded replies
    - Post before seeing replies (advanced, if pre-populating)

## Track who has/hasn't contributed

Check out - [Excel sheet CASA](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Higher-Ed-Canvas-Users/Automated-report-of-group-sets-groups-and-members-in-a-course/bc-p/585458/emcs_t/S2h8ZW1haWx8ZGlnZXN0X25vdGlmaWNhdGlvbnxMTzhLRkJQOEk2QktHQnwtMXxPVEhFUlN8aEs#M2628)

Provide

- Identity of teacher(s) to track

Need to show for each student

- a list of all the discussion forums
- details on each of their contributions to those forums
    - title, date, size, AI generated summary?
    - whether any of them have been marked
    - who else has responded - has the teacher responded as a reply
- whether the forum has been marked

Would need to be code. Nothing apparently possible from Canvas.
