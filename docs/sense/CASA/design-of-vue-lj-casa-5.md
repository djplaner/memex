List of current development tasks for the [Canvas Learning Journal](https://github.com/djplaner/canvas-learning-journal)

## Current work

- Refine the async call to Canvas API 

    There are problems with cljStatusLearningJournal.vue trying to access data that hasn't been retrieved from Canvas yet.  it's being instantiated before the data is available. Suggesting that we will need to do this for every component using the deeper structures in the store

    One solution to this would be if the mounting of the root component `await`s the completion of the Canvas API. There appears to be a way to have an `async` mount handler in Vue. This might be the option

- Defining group set status as a learning journal 

    - [ ] document [status](vue-canvas-learning-journal.md#group-set--learning-journal-states)
    - [ ] lmsDataApi - implement a 'learningJournalState' property
    - [ ] modify cljEveryone to show that state/status
    - [ ] modify cljGroupSet to show the state/status
- refining the GraphQL query to get all the data 

    - Did some initial work but now refining as working on each component

- [x] Implement initial root components just the infrastructure
- canvasApiData 

    - [ ] Clean up [canvasApiData](#canvasapidata) to do list 
    - [X] Getting discussions data via REST API
    - [ ] Getting the contents of discussion topics for a groupset via REST API
    - [ ] check/update to get all group set information
    - [ ] identify if a group set can be a learning journal
    - [ ] get the prompt data - identify when this should ðŸ™‹ 

        e.g. at load time or when/if the group set is displayed (latter seems a good choice)
    - [ ] Implement methods to be used by other components

- Start implement cljOrchestrate

    - [ ] Waiting for data to be retrieved
        Not currently being done
    - [ ] Error retrieving data
    - [ ] Data successfully retrieved **currently working roughly**

## canvasApiData

- [x] Rename functions to be more specific to the Canvas Learning Journal (rather than course)
- [x] transform the GraphQL object into something a little more useful - see [[design-of-vue-lj-data-structures]]
- [ ] Be able to get all the learning journal data (drawn from LearningJournal class from Python version)

    - [x] discussion topics (global)
    - [ ] group set topics and messages

    - Course level??

        - [x] `teachers` 
        - [ ] `staff_list`
        - [x] `students` - i.e. those in the section?? or all students???

    - Group set level

        - [ ] `members`
        - [ ] `stats`

        - `prompts` - Prompt level (part of each group set) - prompts (array of dicts)

            - [ ] `prompt_stats`
            - [ ] `assignment` info about the assignment, including discussion topic?
            - [ ] `responses` array of dicts for all responses to a prompt

                - `topic_id` - discussion topic information (specific to the group)
                - `group_id` 
                -  `prompt_topic` - the actual discussion topic object 
                - `entries` full discussion topic
                - `entry_stats`


        - `groups`  (part of each group set)

- [ ] Add in specific CLJ methods
    - `isGroupSetALearningJournal`
    - `getNumLearningJournals`
    - `getNoGroupStudents`
