title: Ateleological versus teleological
---
Introna (1996) proposed a distinction between ateleological and teleoogical design.

| Attributes of the design process | Teleological development | Ateleological development |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ultimate purpose | Goal/purpose | Wholeness/harmony |
| Intermediate goals | Effectiveness/efficiency | Equilibrium/homeostasis | 
| Design focus | Ends/result | Means/process | 
| Designers | Explicit designer | Member/part | 
| Design scope | Part | Whole | 
| Design process | Creative problem solving | Local adaptation, reflection and learning |
| Design problems | Complexity and conflict | Time | 
| Design management | Centralized | Decentralized |
| Design control | Direct intervention in line with a master plan | Indirect via rules and regulators |
