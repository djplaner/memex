A great deal of what humans do harnesses technology. At least if using the definition of technology offered by Arthur (2009) as "the orchestration of phenomena for some purpose". With this definition, language is a technology. A rocket ship is technology. etc. Gather, weave, and augment is one way to thinking about how to better orchestrate phenomena for some purpose. Originally applied to [work in higher education learning and teaching enhancement](https://djon.es/blog/2023/02/09/gathers-weavers-and-augmenters-three-principles-for-dynamic-and-sustainable-delivery-of-quality-learning-and-teaching/), the following explores how it might be applied more broadly.

Earlier resources, include

- [[gatherers-weavers-augmenters]] draft of the blog post associated with a conference presentation
- An exploration of the [[bad_set-casa-gather-weave|relationship between various "mini-theories"]].
- Related [[gather-weave-literature]]
- Some incomplete thinking on [[gatherers]]
- An attempt to conceptualising [[teaching-as-gather-weave-augment]] and some literature talking about [[teaching-as-interweaving]]
- A connection made between the idea of weaving and [[digital-renovator]] and arriving at [[digital-weaver]]

## ðŸš§ thinking outloud ðŸš§ 

Examining each of gather/weave/augment might provide guidance 

### Points to ponder

Agentic AI, LLMs etc

- Agentic AI automating gather/weave/augment, what are the drawbacks?
- How does it differ from Robotic Process [[automation]]?

### Gather

Are you free/able to gather from the broadest possible range of sources? What are the barriers on which strands can be used?

### Weave

How easily and effectively can different strands be woven together?

### Augment

For whose purpose are you augmenting? How close to your own?
