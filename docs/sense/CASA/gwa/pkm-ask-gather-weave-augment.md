!!! note "ðŸš§  Under construction  ðŸš§ "

The idea of [[gather-weave-augment]] (GWA) has some strong resonance with the Jarche's seek/sense/share (SSS) [[pkm]] approach. GWA is intended as a more abstract concept, not just limited to PKM. However, the idea of leveraging diverse threads to some aim seems to be a common theme between the two. The following aims to explore that a touch more, hopefully to eventually inform personal practice.

Gather/weave has obvious similarities to seek/sense.
