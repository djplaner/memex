Nascent idea to implement a Learning Journal [[casa]] for the Canvas LMS using Vue.js. Adapting the design from the Python version of [[canvas-learning-journal]]

Steps

1. [X] Review the design of [[canvas-learning-journal]] - [[vue-learning-journal-design]]
2. [ ] Consider the design of the Vue application - 
   - [X] [[design-of-vue-lj-casa-1]] - early Vue considerations
   - [x] [[design-of-vue-lj-casa-2]] - finalising the use of Vue and Quasar as the UI framework 
   - [ ] [[design-of-vue-lj-casa-3]] - design/implementation of root components
   - [ ] [[design-of-vue-lj-casa-4]] - design of root components
   - [ ] [[design-of-vue-lj-casa-5]] - development tasks
   - [ ] [[design-of-vue-lj-data-structures]] - current data structures 
     - thoughts on Vue.stores

3. [ ] Create a Vue application

## Basic design

Canvas group sets are turned into "learning journals" by creating single person groups. Each group has a number of "prompts" that are used to spark student contributions. Prompts are Canvas discussion topics. They can be graded or not graded depending on the learning design.

The tool provides additional functionality to 

1. Configure a learning journal

   - Create a group set with the correct settings for a learning journal
   - Be aware and update groupset membership for new students
2. Orchestrate a learning journal

   - Gain an overview of student (and staff) contributions to their learning journals 

      - Who has/hasn't made a contribution
      - What contributions have bee made
   - Access to basic actions to take in response to student contributions

      - Read contributions
      - Comment on contributions
      - Mark contributions (where appropriate)

### Group set / Learning journal states

A learning journal is a specially configured group set, it includes

- group's have only one student member
- self-signup is turned off 
- there are group discussion topics (prompts)

The presence of group discussion topics is the main distinction. The others are nice for private learning journals, but without them the tool could be more broadly useful.

Possible status

- private - single person groups, no self-signup
- learning journal - prompts and groups
- no prompts - no prompts or no groups
- no groups - but not self-sign up

| Status | Description | 
|--------|-------------|
| private && learning journal | single person groups, no signup, prompts |
| learning journal | groups, more than one person or self-signup, prompts |
| incomplete private learning journal | single person group, no self-sign up, prompts |
| incomplete |
