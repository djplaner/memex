[Birding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birdwatching) (aka birdwatching) is a hobby I'm slowly adopting. Largely out of simply having more time to ponder my surroundings, especially [[wood-duck-meadows|home]].

It's also a source of experimentation around how to document [[wood-duck-observations|observations]]. My [[life-list]] is using the newest method, while the [life-list-gallery](./life-list-gallery.md) uses an older, deprecated approach.
