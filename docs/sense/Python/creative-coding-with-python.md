Experiments with [[creative-coding]]. Initially using the Python [Manim (community) library](https://www.manim.community/). But quickly branching out in ASCII art, Processing etc. 

Rationale for Manim was that creative coding/Manim have good potential for [[teaching]], including

1. [[teaching-mathematics]] - visualisations of mathematical concepts.
2. [[teaching-digital-technologies]] - creative coding as a project to engage students/demonstrate the potential of digital technologies. (see [[AC9TDI8P09]])

## Explorations

| Date | Link | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2023-12-28 | [[creative-coding-log-2]] | Getting set up and started - mostly Manim |
| 2023-12-30 | [[creative-coding-log-2]] | Start looking at books and Processing options - landing on py5  |
| 2024-01-14 | [[creative-coding-log-3]] | First explorations with py5 resulting in xmas-001  |
