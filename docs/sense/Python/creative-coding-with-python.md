Explorations into [creative coding] using the Python [Manim (community) library](https://www.manim.community/). Rationale is that creative coding/Manim have good potential for [[teaching]], including

1. [[teaching-mathematics]] - visualisations of mathematical concepts.
2. [[teaching-digital-technologies]] - creative coding as a project to engage students/demonstrate the potential of digital technologies. (see [[AC9TDI8P09]])
