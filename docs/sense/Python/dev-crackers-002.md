- [ ] [Binary arithmetic in scratch?](#binary-arithmetic-in-scratch)


## Binary arithmetic in scratch

Required binary arithmetic revolves around generating the lists of numbers from 1 to that contain each of the binary bits

Or, I could just hard code it and not need binary.

Plan 

- Hard code the "cards" as images (sprites)
  - Limitation - range must be known up front
- User selects yes/no with the cumulative total being updated by hard coded number
- Showing the number at the end


### Scenes

- I can read your mind

    Show fortune teller with spooky music playing. Have a start button to switch to next scene

- Instructions

    Same fortune teller but looking somewhat differently giving Instructions

    - Choose a number from 1 to 63 
    - Look at 5 cards with lots of numbers
    - tell me if your number is/isn't on the card
    - I'll guess your number
    - Start
