## What is it?

To describe and exchange metadata - standardised exchange of data based on relationships. The semantic web is based on RDF

Can provide more interesting information about an entity and its relatiosnhips

## How does it work?

RDF statements are the form of triples of

- _subject_ - resource being described.
- _predicate_  - relationship between the subject and object.
- _object_ - value of the property.

This can be expressed in difference "syntaxes". Initially XML, then others.

The nodes can be of three types
 - URI;
 - Literal;
 - Blank node identifier.
