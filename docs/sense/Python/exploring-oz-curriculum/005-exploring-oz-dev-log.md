Intent is to start generating markdown pages using Foam format for eventual inclusion in memex.

## To do

- [ ] Initial design of pages
- [ ] Develop AC/RDFLib class to start creating
- [ ] Implement

## Initial design

Page structure

- v9-australian-curriculum.md - "home" page

  Initially generate a list of learning areas/subjects (my subset). Learning areas and subjects will be used interchangeably. As the main unit for descriptions etc.

- _learning area_.md - all details for a given learning area/subject

  Organised by year level - preceeded by any learning area level information. Each year level contains the general year level information (not context descriptions) as accordions or similar. Then a table of content descriptions that are links to individual pages. Use of tooltips to contain the descriptions' summaries

  See also: v9-australian-curriculum.md

- _content description code_.md - all information for the content description

  Detail, elaborations, related content and my own notes.
