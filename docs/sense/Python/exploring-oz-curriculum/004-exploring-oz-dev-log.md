# 004-exploring-oz-dev-log



Finally getting some glimmers of understanding using `rdflib`. Use of `predictate_objects` method to get all the objects for a given subject.

`recurse.py` developed to walk the graph and get all the relevant information required. Integrate that into the `acLearningArea.py` class in [[005-exploring-oz-dev-log]]

## What do I need to do

- [X] Simple test - list all content descriptions and some properties
- [X] Exploration - understand the parent/child structure of all components

    e.g. content descriptions belong to?







## Exploration - parent/child structure

### Manual inspection of MAT.rdf

`statementNotation` ==root - copyright statement etc (19679b09-cfba-4cd0-a02e-366ace2f3d83)

- `statementNotation` "LA"  `title` "Learning Areas" (c357c885-ff1c-465e-a521-81339382c9a5)

    One appears to be holder of learning areas
    - `statementNotation` "Learning Area" `title` "Mathematics" (5261cb07-bce5-435d-a979-b161a432016d)

### Automate inspection

Recursive function to walk through the tree

#### `getRootId(g)` - working

Given a graph get the subjectId for predicate _statementNotation_ and object _root_. Check that only one should be returned.

#### `recurseOzCurriculum(g, subjectId, depth=0)`

Given the graph and the rootId (known as subjectId within the function as it recurses down), recurse through the tree, keeping track of the depth.

- Get all the predicates and objects that have `subjectId` as the subject.
- Split all the predicates/objects (pos) into either children or information. 
- display information about the node (not the children)

  - only for the predicates: `statmentNotation`, `statementLabel`, `title`

- loop through all the node children and recurse from there
    
### Revealing

Some nodes are not included, e.g. 
- `statementLabel` = _Achievement Standard_
- Level Descriptions are included as subject `dcterms:description` for `statementLabel` _Level_

root
- LA/Learning Areas
  - MAT/Mathematics
    - MATMAT/Mathematics
    - MATMATFY/Foundation Year
      - MATMATFY_1NUM/Number
        - AC9MFN01/<content descriptor title>
          - AC9MFN01_E1/<content elaboration title>
          - more elaborations
        - more content descriptors

### Exploration of where Achievement Standards fit

Related `statementLabel` predicates

- _Achievement Standard_ 
  - http://vocabulary.curriculum.edu.au/MRAC/2023/07/LA/MAT/21ec0e04-b342-4210-8dd9-7f98c13bb7d3
- _Achievement Standard Component_
  - http://vocabulary.curriculum.edu.au/MRAC/2023/07/LA/MAT/287b5015-eff7-462f-a89a-8e14159cb452
  - children of achievement standards
- Related Content and other features are under the `skillEmbodied` predicate

  21ec0e04-b342-4210-8dd9-7f98c13bb7d3 is found in 

  - predicate `hasLevel` for `statmentLabel` _Level_ - same subject as the description i.e. year level

`hasLevel` (http://purl.org/ASN/schema/core/hasLevel) is defined as "resource description of a level of performance based on RubricCriterion"

- Content Descriptions and Year Levels have them - need to add them for recursion
