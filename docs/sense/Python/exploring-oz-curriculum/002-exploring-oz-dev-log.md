# Exploring Oz Curriculum - Dev log 2

See also: [[exploring-australian-curriculum]]

## Tasks 

- [X] Download and import v9 of the Australian Curriculum
- [X] Identify components of v9 curriculum
- [ ] Explore notions of ontology, RDF, and graph databases
- [ ] What ontologies re: mathematical concepts exist?
- [ ] Design how to link with memex

## v9 curriculum - download and import

### Download

- [X] Is there a download? - [Machine-readable Australian Curriculum (MRAC)](https://v9.australiancurriculum.edu.au/machine-readable-australian-curriculum)

Provided in HTML, RDF/XML, [JSON LD](https://json-ld.org/), and [a SPARQL endpoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL).  The HTML version is a just a page with a description and link to the RDF.

Organised into the following categories each with individual downloads for separate values:

- Learning Areas 
- General Capability 
- Cross-curriulum priorities

Questions 

1. Which version to use: RDF, JSON LD?

    RDF appears the core version and Python has [RDFLib](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib).  sqlite-utils can import JSON, but doesn't appear to have anything explicit for JSON-LD. Suggesting a bit more work, which may be required for RDF anyway.
2. How to get those into sqllite?
3. Other options for querying/interacting with the data?

### Experiment with Mathematics learning area

**Download RDF and JSON files**

RDF initial explorations not great. Wondering if JSON LD might be more recent/accessible. 

Going to have to learn more about [[rdf]]

**Explore use of rdf-to-sqlite**

[rdf-to-sqlite](https://github.com/bradleypallen/rdf-to-sqlite) python module to convert RDF file into SQLite database tables (inspiried by datasette related work)

Does require identification of the _RDF serialisation format_.  [This](https://ontola.io/blog/rdf-serialization-formats) suggests that RDF/XML is the most common and what is used by the given file

```sh
rdf-to-sqlite v9.db ../data/v9/MAT.rdf --format xml --context https://schema.org/docs/jsonldcontext.jsonld
Generated v9.db (33604 rows in 26 tables)
``` 

That's a lot of rows and tables. Suggesting a possible limitation. Illustrated in the following table. Not a lot of curriculum specific structure visible in the tables.

Part of the challenge will be disentangling the complexity of the vocabulary etc. and transforming that into something specific.  Putting the context back into data, reducing the reusability. [[reusability-paradox]]

**Mapping out content**

Content description (e.g. label AC9M7N01) 

- found in tags `<statementNotation>`
- the value is in `<dcterms:title>`
- `dcterms:description` also useful for expanded information
- also `<nominalYearLevel>` grade level
- `<statementLabel>` - has the value "Content Description"

statementLabel values

- 11 Achievement Standard
- 185 Achievement Standard Component
- 240 Content Description
- 996 Elaboration
- 1 Learning Area
- 11 Level
- 63 Strand
- 1 Subject
