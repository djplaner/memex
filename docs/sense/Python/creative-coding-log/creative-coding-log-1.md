[[creative-coding-log-1|Log 1]] got Manim underway. The following looks to learn more about creating my own Manim animations/images by leveraging some creative coding examples.

- [ ] Explore some creative coding books/websites - choose some
- [ ] Implement


## Creative coding resources

### Artut (2023)

Seems a good first choice since explicitly looking at geometric patterns and not explicitly linked to a particular environment. But ends up focusing on [ps5.js](https://p5js.org/).

First four chapters give some good background. 

Chapter 6 includes

- creating geometric patterns with hand tools, which includes the algorithm in some detail
- the first is dividing a circle into 6 and 12 equal sections using a compass and a ruler
- first part of that uses three intersecting circles to create an equal sided hexagon
