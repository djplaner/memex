[[creative-coding-log-1|Log 1]] got Manim underway. The following looks to learn more about creating my own Manim animations/images by leveraging some creative coding examples.

- [ ] Explore some creative coding books/websites - choose some
- [ ] Implement


## Creative coding resources

### Artut (2023)

Seems a good first choice since explicitly looking at geometric patterns and not explicitly linked to a particular environment. But ends up focusing on [ps5.js](https://p5js.org/).

First four chapters give some good background. 

Chapter 6 includes

- creating geometric patterns with hand tools, which includes the algorithm in some detail
- the first is dividing a circle into 6 and 12 equal sections using a compass and a ruler
- first part of that uses three intersecting circles to create an equal sided hexagon

## p5.js, Processing, and Python

Artut (2023) and many others use Processing or p5.js. Can I get something going in Python?

### Possible implementations

p5.js

- [pyp5js](https://berinhard.github.io/pyp5js/) - uses "transcrypt"?

    2 years since on major work on [GitHub repo](https://github.com/berinhard/pyp5js) but some activity in issues. Comes with all the tutorials.

Processing

- [Python mode for processing](https://py.processing.org/)

    Actually part of Processing community. Positioning process as a "arts-centric system for learning, teaching, and making visual art with code".

### [Getting started with Python more for Processing](https://py.processing.org/tutorials/gettingstarted/)

Tutorial from 2010. Need to download Processing first. 

Works. Now to download the Python mode. The age of the tutorial is showing here. Looks like Processing has moved on.

That works. Processing is a stand alone GUI in which you write code and press play. It generates an open window with the result of the sketch.  Probably a better fit for those new to coding. As a coder, I wonder if VS Code has something? Apparently not.

Though that low barrier to entry is quite good.

### p5 - Python native Processing

[GitHub](https://github.com/p5py/p5) - seems reasonably active

Installation is a bit of a pain. But works. Too high for class use?
