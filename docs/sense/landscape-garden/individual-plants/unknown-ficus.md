The [[roundabout]] includes a mature, very large Ficus (fig tree). We're yet to formally identify. At various stages we've labelled it a Moreton Bay fit or a Council tree (Ficus altissima).

## History at Wood Duck Meadows

The first was planted by previous owners in the [[roundabout]]. Hopefully many more to come.
