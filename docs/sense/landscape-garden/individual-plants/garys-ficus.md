Making friends is one of the benefits of volunteering at [Redwood Park](https://fep.org.au/our-parks/redwood-park/) with the [Friends of the Escarpment Parks](https://fep.org.au). Friends who have surplus plants, including the odd ficus to give away. Planted in late 2024 in the [[gatton-creek-frontage]] this ficus is growing well.
