With [[the-dam]] level low during 2024 we planted out a [[sandpaper-fig]] onto [[the-island]]. iNaturalist suggests that it is a [[ficus-opposita]]. [Cyclone Alfred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_Alfred_(2025)) and a subsequent low kept the dam level high, making it interesting to water the fig.
