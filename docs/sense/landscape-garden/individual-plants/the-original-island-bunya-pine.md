This big [[araucaria-bidwillii]] was and is the center piece of [[the-island]] at [[wood-duck-meadows]]. By the time we started [[regeneration]] work it had been largely  overgrown by [[asparagus-africanus]].

## Bunya pine cone production

Prior to 2025 we've seen no cones. But we weren't looking.

### 2025

Gathered a good collection of cones in early January 2025.

### 2026

Evidence of another crop of cones being formed. Already picking up some from other bunya pines on the property.
