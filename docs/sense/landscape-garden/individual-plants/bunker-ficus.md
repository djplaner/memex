During 2025 we noticed that somehow a ficus sapling had taken root on the northern wall of the bunker.

!!! info "Status - February 2026 - alive and growing and still unidentified"

    It's a good few months of hot weather and not much rain and the ficus is hanging on and doing fairly well. Currently home to at least three paper wasp nests.

    Not 100% certain of which species of ficus it is, but best current guess is probably [[ficus-obliqua|a small-leaved fig]] just like its bigger neighbour the [[ficus-obliqua-berm]]

See the [[multiple-attachments]] photo story for a more photos, including a close up of the first wasp's nest.
