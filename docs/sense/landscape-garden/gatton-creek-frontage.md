title: Gatton creek frontage
type: zone
---
About a half-acre of largely ignored [eucalypt woodland](https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/plants-animals/habitats/habitat/eucalypt-woodlands) running between the main driveway and Gatton Creek. An ad hoc small collection of scrub trees in a largely grassy area spread between some "suburban" shrubs and the slowly encroaching lantana, madeira vine and other weeds climbing up the creek bank.

Initial intent is to clean it up and transform it into something far more native and enjoyable. Perhaps a [[dry-rainforest]]?
