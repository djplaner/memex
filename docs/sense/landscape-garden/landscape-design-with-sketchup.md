Sketchup is a tool for creating geometry.

## Nascent process

From the Sketchup landscape design course

1. Base modeling 
2. Terrain & grading 
3. Materials & textures 
4. Site furnishings & entourage 
5. Vegetation 
6. Context modeling
7. Optimisation, collaboration and revisions


7. Start in 2D
8. Geolocate 
    - Use the feature and then perform tidy ups e.g 
      - Explore using the terrain map as the working space 
      - Hide/reveal the satellite image as required
9. Improve the terrain 
10. Add established features 

    - e.g. build 3d models of existing buildings and plants


## Process ideas

1. Start in 2D

    Use the 2D view to give a top-down view to start.

2. Group almost everything, group early

## Concepts

Geometry created in Sketchup consists of three things: endpoints; edges; faces. Most features are focused on changing some combination of these.
