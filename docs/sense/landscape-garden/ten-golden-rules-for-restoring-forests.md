[Open access research](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.15498) (Di Sacco et al, 2021) arising from [Botanic Gardens Conservation International (BGCI)](https://www.bgci.org/news-events/scientists-lay-out-10-golden-rules-for-restoring-forests/) developed 10 "golden rules" for reforestation.


1. Protect existing forest first; 

    Start with what we have.
2. Work together (involving all stakeholders); 
3. Aim to maximize biodiversity recovery to meet multiple goals; 
4. Select appropriate areas for restoration; 
5. Use natural regeneration wherever possible; 
6. Select species to maximize biodiversity; 
7. Use resilient plant material (with appropriate genetic variability and provenance); 
8. Plan ahead for infrastructure, capacity and seed supply; 
9. Learn by doing (using an adaptive management approach); and 
10. Make it pay (ensuring the economic sustainability of the project).

## Misc quotes

> Trees, and the forests they form, are highly complex. Their interactions with other plants, animals and fungi, and environmental phenomena such as fires and flooding, have led to the evolution of a remarkable diversity of species, genes, functions and ecosystems (Di Sacco et al, 2021, p, 1329).
