Fed by road runoff the dam surrounds [[the-island]] and (occasionally) provides some nice water views from the house.

## Seasonal levels

The dam is seasonal and fed largely by road runoff. At times it can be dry for extended periods. At other times it can be full and overflow into the neighbour's place making for one large dam.

However, there is a limit. The dam bank has an overflow section designed into it. A section put to good use due to the heavy rain of early 2025.

## Clearing

Most of the work around the dam has been clearing out various weeds in an attempt to give the native vegetation a chance.

All the rain of 2025 combined with early clearing work created a nice spot for the ducks to graze and hang out during the day.
