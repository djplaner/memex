The front of [[wood-duck-meadows]] has a small stand of [brigalow scrub](https://www.lfwseq.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/RE-Fact-Sheet_12.8.23_HLW.pdf). It appears to be a fairly health, but small, example of this ecosystem. A very good canopy providing a good amount of shade and no obvious signs of weed invasion.

## Possibilities

Long term aim is to increase the size of this stand. Perhaps exploring the option of expanding [mixing in dry rainforest trees](https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/plants-animals/habitats/regrowth/regrowth-guides/brigalow/brigalow-ecology)
