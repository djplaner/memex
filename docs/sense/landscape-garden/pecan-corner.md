Another area set aside for fruit and nut trees (see [[orchard-corner]]). Originally including pecan trees which later suffered a weedeater incident. Pecan Corner - like all the fruit tree heavy zones - is Sandy's area. She's done much more work on these areas than captured by the following history of the work I've performed.
