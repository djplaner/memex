We're slowly developing a specific regeneration process for our property by combining insights from elsewhere with our own experience. Our overall process is to combine aspects of [[permaculture]] and [[permaculture-principles]] (e.g. obtain a yield) with a slightly stronger focus on ecological restoration.

## Context

[[wood-duck-meadows]] is located within the Lockyer Valley. There are a number of [regionally appropriate habitat types](https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/plants-animals/habitats/habitat) that we may be looking to regenerate/develop, including

- [Eucalypt woodlands](https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/plants-animals/habitats/habitat/eucalypt-woodlands), 

    The [[gatton-creek-frontage]] zone is almost a Eucalypt woodland now. Given its size, [[the-circle]] zone would be a good candidate for this habitat type. 

- [Brigalow scrub](https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/plants-animals/habitats/habitat/brigalow), and 

    The [[brigalow-scrub]] zone is a small but well established example. We're unlikely to significantly expand this habitat type, but we definitely wish to retain and strengthen its.

- [dry rainforest](https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/plants-animals/habitats/habitat/dry-rainforest) and [semi-evergreen vine thickets (aka dry rainforest)](https://apps.des.qld.gov.au/regional-ecosystems/details/?re=12.8.21).

    There are dry rainforest trees spread across the property, including: [[bunya-pine]], hoop pines; [[macadamia]] trees; [[harpullia-pendula]] (Tulipwoods); numerous fig trees of different species (e.g. [[unknown-ficus]]); and, some bottletrees.

## Activities

A regeneration process is likely to include some of the following activities

- Reducing invasive species.
- Mitigating weeds and erosion.
- Replanting and introducing species.

### Reducing invasive species

### Mitigating weeds and erosions

### Replanting and introducing species
