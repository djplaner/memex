Located just above the [[lower-dam]], the vegetable beds region is set aside for [[raised-garden-beds]], associated activities (e.g. compositing), and hopefully plentiful harvests of vegetables. 

First step was to clear by hand the weeds and grass taking up the area. Mostly [[megathyrsus-maximus]], ad hoc small weeds, and [[asparagus-africanus]]. Doing it by hand - rather than a weedeater - enabled the discovery of a couple of [[eustrephus-latifolius]] vines. The [[asparagus-africanus]] and [[eustrephus-latifolius]] growing over the stump of a fallen hoop pine. A [[jasminum-polyanthum]] vine was also making its home over the same stump.
