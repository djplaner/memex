![Overview photo of the property with a blue polygon showing the location of the "Front Yard". Extending from the house to the right of the image toward the front entrance on the left hand side of the image. The polygon is thinner toward the front of the property as the property itself narrows.](./images/front-yard-location.jpg)
<caption>The "front yard" is a semi-open area laying between the house and the front entrance. Bordered on either side by the [[gatton-creek-frontage]] and [[cherry-tree-walk]]<caption>
