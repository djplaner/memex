## What

Method for determining the ratio of sand, silt and clay in soil. For identifying the [soil texture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_texture)

## Materials

- Straight-edged, clear jar with lid 
- Marker 
- Ruler 
- Sieve

## Method

1. Gather soil sample and sieve to remove debris, rocks and large organic matter.
2. Fill the jar 1/3 full with soil.
3. Fill the jar with water leaving some space.
4. Cap the jar and shake vigorously into a uniform slurry.
5. Set on flat surface for one minute.
6. Mark the level of the sand that has settled at the bottom.
7. Leave the jar for 2 hours.
8. Mark the level of the silt that has settled on top of the sand.
9. Leave the jar for 2 days.
10. Mark the level of the clay that has settled on top of the silt.
11. Use a rule to measure and record the height of each layer and the total height.
12. Use the [soil texture triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_texture#/media/File:SoilTextureTriangle.svg) to estimate the soil type.
