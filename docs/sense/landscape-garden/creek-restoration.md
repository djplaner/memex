Initially a set of notes taken from Whyte (2013), perhaps eventually some plans for restoration of the relevant portions of the [[gatton-creek-frontage]] and [[rocky-creek-frontage]]

> a creek is freshwater flowing from high to low along the paths of least resistance. (Whyte, 2013, p. 11)

## Method

1. Remove the invaders
2. Repair the structural damage
3. Replant with original vegetation of hardy, locally-native species

## Plants

Common good trees along SE Qld creeks include:

- Creek Myrtle Syzygium floribundum, previously Waterhousea, 
- Black Bean Castanospermum australe, 
- She Oak Casuarina cunninghamiana, 
- River Bottlebrush Melaleuca viminalis, 
- Black Tea Tree Melaleuca bracteata, 
- Three-veined Laurel, Crytopcarya triplinervis, 
- Whalebone Tree Streblus brunonianis, 
- Water Gum Tristaniopsis laurina, 
- Native Elm Aphananthe philippinensis and 
- Lilly Pillies Syzygium spp.

## Notes

> A well-planned restoration is all about working with nature. It’s about recreating the opportunities for natural systems to restore themselves. To do this, you remove the invaders, repair the structural damage and replant with the original vegetation community of hardy, locally-native species. (Whyte, 2013, p. 6)
