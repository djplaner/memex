Often occurring in areas that experience significant seasonal droughts. A low to medium canopy layer that is uneven. With a mixture of evergreen, semi-evergreen and deciduous tree species. The canopy may be open or closed. Twining or scrambling plants are prominent. As a rainforest it has the ability to regenerate.

Can be more susceptible to weed invasion due to more open canopy.

## Regeneration advice

The [Rainforest regrowth management guidelines](https://www.publications.qld.gov.au/dataset/423dafdb-be26-4aba-b225-1fab3495f7bf/resource/48792874-4ef2-4ecc-814d-565460ee7969/download/rainforest-regrowth-mgmt-guideline.pdf) provide some advice. Some of which is summarised here.

Regeneration from scratch is difficulty due to slow plant growth rates and that far less is known about such work.

Initial advice seems to be to re-establish the canopy, limit weeds and grazing, and encourage natural regeneration. Which seems to equate to:

- Establish the canopy through planting appropriate trees.
- Eventually plan vines, shrubs and ground covers.

Site preparation

- Cover bare ground with mulch. 
- Revegetate using maximum diversity method and direct seeding.
- Consider supplementary planting of large-fruited tree species.
- Establish a diversity of rainforest plant species.
