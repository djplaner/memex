Often occurring in areas that experience significant seasonal droughts. A low to medium canopy layer that is uneven. With a mixture of evergreen, semi-evergreen and deciduous tree species. The canopy may be open or closed. Twining or scrambling plants are prominent. As a rainforest it has the ability to regenerate.

Can be more susceptible to weed invasion due to more open canopy.

## Regeneration advice

### Qld government guidlines

The [Rainforest regrowth management guidelines](https://www.publications.qld.gov.au/dataset/423dafdb-be26-4aba-b225-1fab3495f7bf/resource/48792874-4ef2-4ecc-814d-565460ee7969/download/rainforest-regrowth-mgmt-guideline.pdf) provide some advice. Some of which is summarised here.

Regeneration from scratch is difficulty due to slow plant growth rates and that far less is known about such work.

Initial advice seems to be to re-establish the canopy, limit weeds and grazing, and encourage natural regeneration. Which seems to equate to:

- Establish the canopy through planting appropriate trees.
- Eventually plan vines, shrubs and ground covers.

Site preparation

- Cover bare ground with mulch. 
- Revegetate using maximum diversity method and direct seeding.
- Consider supplementary planting of large-fruited tree species.
- Establish a diversity of rainforest plant species. 

### Rainforest CRC

Following taken from the report ["Rainforest restoration activities in Australia's tropics and subtropics"](https://rainforest-crc.jcu.edu.au/publications/restoration_activities.pdf) from the [JCU Rainforest CRC](https://rainforest-crc.jcu.edu.au)

Common attempts involve:

- Weed control
- Planting to fill gaps/increase area
- planting to establish corridor linkages to other rainforest

Identifies four pathways of restoration of Australian rainforests

- ecological restoration - reinstatement of diverse native rainforest
- farm forestry - mainly for timber production
- (enhancement) Regrowth - both managed and unmanaged

Vegetation reinstatement techniques typically involve **"planting seedlings of rainforest trees at a high density"** with the intent of quickly establishing a canopy which subsequently start generating shade and leaf litter. 1 to 2 metres between plants. High early planting density also leads to development of structural features required by fauna: high foliage volume, dead timber, leaf litter, trunk crevices, and areas of vine tangle or dense stems.

From the late 1990s saw significant effort in Australia to restore bush of all descriptions. Work exhibiting "relatively little emphasis on documentation and record-keeping". Largely due to participants being "too busy".

> The achievement of canopy closure is a significant threshold, which corresponds with a change in biodiversity and ecological processes towards a more rainforest-like state (Kanowski et al.  2003; Erskine et al. 2005; Catterall et al. in press)

Kanowski et al (2004) and Catterall et al (in press) identify three phases of vegetation development

1. _establishment phase_ - during which the canopy has not yet closed.
2. _building phase_ - development of diverse rainforest flora and fauna and the ecological processes that support them.
3. _maintenance phase_ - processes stablise at a level similar to an intact rainforest.

### South Eastern Australia

Peel, B. (2010). *Rainforest restoration manual for south-eastern Australia*. CSIRO Pub.

Key findings include:

> - Rainforest restoration is possible; it works rapidly and rainforest-dependent species will start to use restored sites within 3 years. 
> - Integrated weed management is critical to your success and that weeds kill rainforest stone dead. 
> - Adaptive management is the foundation stone of good (efficient, flexible) rainforest restoration. 
> - Keeping roots cool (with mulch or shade) is fundamental to the establishment of rainforest species (including pioneers and secondary species).
