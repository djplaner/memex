---

The mounds are a series of small earth mounds located above the [[lower-dam]] and below the [[horse-paddock]]. The [[vegetable-beds]] are located to the east of the mounds. Our [[creating-compost|compost bins]] are located on the southern end of the mounds.

Currently a collection of ad hoc weeds, panic grass with some young trees slowly coming back.
