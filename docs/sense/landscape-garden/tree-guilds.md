A (fruit) tree guild aims to avoid simple planting a fruit tree by itself. Instead, the intent is to create an [small ecosystem](https://www.tenthacrefarm.com/how-to-build-a-fruit-tree-guild/#ecosystem) around the individual tree by planting mutually beneficial species around the tree. A guild consists of plants chosen from multiple layers. Linking multiple tree guilds together creates a food forest.

Effectively designed a tree guild will reduce cost and labour, increase yield and improve the health of the plants. A significant design consideration is the context. Observing the site and what grows well/is required should inform design.

Design considerations

- pathways for required access to all elements of the tree guild;

    e.g. you will perform different actions on different plants (picking from the fruit tree, removing foliage from chop and drop plants etc) in the guild.

- Reduce grass competition 

    Use cardboard initially. Mulches. Plan spring flowering bulbs in a ring around the trunk. 

- Identify insect attractors that flower at the same time as the tree.

    At the outer drop line or a nearby tree.

## Plant layers/purpose

| Layer/Purpose | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Central element | Fruit or nut tree |
| Attract beneficial insects and pollinators | Dill, fennel, parsley, fennel, dill, lavender, bee balm |
| Deter wildlife | Nasturtium, marigold |
| Fertilize/nutrient accumulators | Deep roots bringing nutrients up. Dandelions, yarrow, comfrey |
| Mulch makers | Comfrey, cardoon, rhubarb, nasturtium.|
| Suppress grass | Clover, daffodils, garlic chives, tulips |
| Repel pests | Garlic, Daffodils |
