## Resources

### [What native plants grow in clay?](https://anpsa.org.au/gd_stories/clay-is-a-great-soil-to-have-in-your-native-garden/)

Article on Australian Native Plants Society site giving a list of plans and method for preparing soil. Advises use of tubestock. Gives a long list of plants that work on their site but the focus seems to be on plants that thrive on the clay rather than improving the soil. At least there is no discussion of any role the given plants may play in soil improvement.

### [Clay busting plants](https://www.tenthacrefarm.com/clay-busting-plants/)

More permaculture oriented focused on list of plants but for vegetable beds?
