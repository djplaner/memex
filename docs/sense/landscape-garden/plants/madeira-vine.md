Leaves
- alternately arranged (one leaf per stem joint (node)) along the stem 
- sub-sessile (with a very small leaf stalk)
- slightly fleshy, bright green, normally glossy above, glabrous (hairless)

## Experience

Initial introduction when working with the [Friends of Redwood Park](https://fep.org.au/our-parks/redwood-park/) where it is one of the major weeds. 

Subsequent identification of some evidence on [[wood-duck-meadows]]. Early infestation coming up from the creeks. Also some evidence of birds bringing it onto [[the-island]]
