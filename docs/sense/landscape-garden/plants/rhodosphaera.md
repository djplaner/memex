[Rhodosphaera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodosphaera) (aka [deep yellowwood](https://sown.com.au/rhodosphaera-rhodanthema-anacardiaceae-deep-yellowwood/)) is a rainforest tree - both sub-tropical and dry - native to eastern Australia. Growing to 25 metres tall. Forms red flowers in panicles during early spring and fruit from late summary into winter.

## History at [[wood-duck-meadows]]

Hugh and Kay provided our first Rhodosphaera in 2025 (or so we thought).

It seems we may have some additional deep yellowwoods already on the property. For example, the following identified on [[the-island]] in August 2025.
