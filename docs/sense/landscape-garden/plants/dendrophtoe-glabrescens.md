For years we'd been aware of some sort of epiphyte-like plant growing on a tree ([[grevillea-robusta]] aka Silky Oak) in the [[front-yard]]. Come November 2025 and we noticed it flowering enabling identification with the help of [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/) as [Dendrophtoe glabrescens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrophtoe_glabrescens) (Orange Mistletoe).

I had wondered whether the name "mistletoe" is another example of a northern hemisphere plant name being misapplied in the southern hemisphere. Especially something as prevalent in northern hemisphere Christmas media as mistletoe (couples, doors, mistletoe, kissing etc with origins [back to pagans](https://hvbackyard.blogspot.com/2007/12/42-under-mistletoe.html)). It turns out that most species of mistletoe are from tropical and subtropical regions, including this one. [Apparently](https://jerry-coleby-williams.net/2015/11/26/miscast-mistletoe-environmental-health-indicators-hiding-in-full-view/) Australia has 90+ species, including around 70 that are endemic.
