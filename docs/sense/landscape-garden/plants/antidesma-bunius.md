[Antidesma bunius (aka Bignay)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidesma_bunius) is a small tree or large shrub native to Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It produces small, round berries that change color from green to red and finally to dark purple or black when ripe. The berries are edible and are often used in jams, jellies, and wines due to their sweet and tart flavor.

Initially planted in the [[front-yard]] as one of the numerous young saplings.
