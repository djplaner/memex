[[wood-duck-meadows]] was designed to provide sizeable horse paddocks, with lots of grass. This includes [Megathyrsus maximus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megathyrsus_maximus) (Guinea grass or green panic) which is a tall, tufted perennial grass that grows in clumps. Which means that after a good season with lots of rain there is a requirement for a lot of mowing. Without which the paddocks are overgrown with stands of 3+ metre high grass. Not surprisingly, this grass is [considered a weed in Queensland](https://weeds.brisbane.qld.gov.au/weeds/guinea-grass)

## History at Wood Duck Meadows

Beyond on-going mowing, throughout 2024 and 2025 there were early starts on removing the grass. At this stage the main method is manual removal of individual tufts.
