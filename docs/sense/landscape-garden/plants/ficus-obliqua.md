The [[fig-tree-berm]] is home to two trees, including what we've identified as a [Ficus obliqua (aka small-leaved fig)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ficus_obliqua). There's a good chance we've got a few more unidentified examples of this species. It can be a big tree growing to 60 metres tall. Though not yet evident on our property, it is a banyan. i.e. it will put down accessory trunks to prop up branches.

The [[australasianFigbird]] is a big fan of these trees, especially from April onwards as the fruit ripen. A source of many sightings and photos.
