[Polyscias elegans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyscias_elegans (aka Celery Wood)) is a small tree or shrub native to the rainforests of New South Wales and Queensland. A fast-growing medium sized tree known as a pioneer species for its fast growth and subsequent shading of invasive species.

Fruit eaten by numerous birds, including the following spotted at [[wood-duck-meadows]]: [[australasianFigBird]], Lewin's honeyeater, and brown cuckoo dove.
