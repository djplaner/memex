Up until late July 2025 it was though that [[wood-duck-meadows]] had a couple of examples of the [[grevillea-robusta]] (Silky Oak) tree. Illustrative of how rarely we moved through the [[back-corner]]. But in July 2025 I spotted a flowering [[ricinus-communis|Castor oil plant]] that looked like it was in the [[back-corner]] (it wasn't). On the plus side, that expedition into the [[back-corner]] did reveal that the known mature [[grevillea-robusta]] in the [[back-corner]] was fulfilling the species' invasive tendency. With 15+ seedlings growing quite well throughout the [[back-corner]]. That apparent invasive tendency will come in handy for our intent for the [[back-corner]].

The Silky Oak (no relation to true oaks) is a fast-growing evergreen tree with fern-like leaves. The species is native to eastern Australia, particularly in New South Wales and Queensland. Originally growing in subtropical and dry rainforests, and wet forests.
