[Pandorea pandorana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandorea_pandorana) (aka Wonga Wonga vine) is a native Australian vine/woody scrambler.


## Wood duck history

Hugh and Kay provided what we thought were our initial examples of Wonga Vine in late 2024/early 2025. Sandy planted this in her rainforest example beside [[the-dam]].

In August 2025 while clearing the area for the [[vegetable-beds]] a couple of mature Wonga vines were discovered.
