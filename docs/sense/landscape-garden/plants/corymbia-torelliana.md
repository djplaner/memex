[Cadaghi (Coymbia Torelliana)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corymbia_torelliana) is a species of tree native to North Queensland which is considered an [environmental pest](https://weeds.brisbane.qld.gov.au/weeds/cadaghi) in South East Queensland. A lovely large tree with a dense canopy providing good shade. A feature that is also a problem with the heavy shade preventing native understorey plants in sub tropical regions. 

[Another issue is the attraction native bees](https://tweedvalleytreeservices.com.au/invasive-tree-species/the-cadaghi-tree/) have to the resin generated by the seeds. As they collect the resin to line their hives they also collect and embed seeds in the hive walls. Eventually the seeds can block entrances raising heat within the hive. Fumes from the resin can then kill the bees.

## Wood duck meadows

[[wood-duck-meadows]] has historically had numerous Cadaghi trees ([[lower-dam]], [[orchard-corner]], [[fig-tree-berm]]) which we have been slowly removing as part of the restoration project. The size of the trees has slowed the process somewhat.
