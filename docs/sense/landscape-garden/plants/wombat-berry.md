Wombat Berry (Eustrephus latifolius) is an evergreen vine native to Australia and other parts of the Pacific and Asia. Usually a somewhat vigorous twining plant, but may also be found as a scrambling ground cover.

Birds are attracted to and eat the berries. Mammals - including wombats - eat the tubers.
