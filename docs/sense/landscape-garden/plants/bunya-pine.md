The [bunya pine (Araucaria bidwillii)](https://theconversation.com/bunya-pines-are-ancient-delicious-and-possibly-deadly-96003) is a evergreen coniferous tree that can grow up to 50m tall. It is native to our local area (south-east Queensland) and have been labelled [as "living fossils"](https://theconversation.com/bunya-pines-are-ancient-delicious-and-possibly-deadly-96003) arising during the Jurassic period.

There are at least four bunya pines at [[wood-duck-meadows]]. One on [[the-island]], two near the [[brigalow-scrub]], and one on the edge of the [[gatton-creek-frontage]].

## Bunya pine cone

The pine cones are large (amongst the largest produced by conifers) and dangerous. Roughly the size of rugby ball (up to 30cm long and 20cm wide) and weighing up to 10 kilograms. Falling from the top of the tree they make an impact.

## History at Wood Duck Meadows

### 2024 clearing the island 

The bunya pine on [[the-island]] - like much of [[the-island]] - was suffering from the impact of [[asparagus-fern]]. The following images illustrate our work to rescue it.

Clearing the asparagus fern from around the tree left disconnected vines high in the bunya pine tree. As illustrated in the following image, this vine died.

The pine cone shown above was the first found (Jan 14) of the 2025 bunya nut season.
