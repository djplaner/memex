Climbing asparagus (Asparagus africanus) is the first [environmental weed](https://weeds.brisbane.qld.gov.au/weeds/climbing-asparagus-fern) aggressively removed from [[wood-duck-meadows]]. Where it grew as a long-lived climber with prickly stems with tiny "leaves" giving a fern-like appearance.

## Wood duck meadows

Asparagus africanus has been found throughout [[wood-duck-meadows]], including: [[the-island]]; on the [[gatton-creek-frontage]] near the [[lower-dam]]; [[orchard-corner]]; on the [[fig-tree-berm]]; within the [[brigalow-scrub]]; and, other areas at the front of the property. 

All removal has been done by hand. Often requiring two or three passes to remove entirely.
