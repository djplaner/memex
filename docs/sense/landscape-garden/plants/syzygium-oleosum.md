Amongst the seedlings we received from Judy (fellow volunteer at [Redwood Park](https://fep.org.au/our-parks/redwood-park/)) was four or so [Syzygium oleosum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syzygium_oleosum) (Blue lilly pilly). A small tree (4 to 15m) native to eastern Australian rainforests or wet sclerophyll forests. The species produces edible purple fruit that are eaten by a variety of birds.

These first four are being planted on [[the-island]].  You can just see the first two just after planting in the bottom left and right corners of the photo below.
