A largish shrub that is prevalent along Gatton and Rocky creeks that run along the boundary of [[wood-duck-meadows]]. Whilst not officially declared a pest in Queensland there is some active dislike of the Castor Oil plant at [[wood-duck-meadows]]. Feelings not helped by my discovery that the [seeds are poisonous to humans and animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricinus) and the observation that it can spread quickly.

The spreading quickly is evident by its spread up and down the Rocky and Gatton creeks, and a tendency to creep into the [[roundabout]] and [[gatton-creek-frontage]] areas. Not to mention further afield into the neighbour's place. The following photo is from the first flowering Castor Oil plant I noticed. Located just over the fence from the [[back-corner]].
