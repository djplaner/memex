Shrub or small tree native to the Americas, but considered an invasive weed in Queensland. Present in the messy creek areas along the northern side of [[wood-duck-meadows]] and generally ignored due to more invasive species (e.g. [[cats-claw-creeper]] and [[madeira-vine]]). Identified a individual Tecoma stans just above the [[lower-dam]] and [[vegetable-beds]] area in October, 2025.
