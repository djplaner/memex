South American shrub considered an environmental [weed in Australia](https://weeds.brisbane.qld.gov.au/weeds/easter-cassia). Can grow up to 4m tall with bright yellow flowers. Prolific fruit production and rapid growth rate means it will outcompete native plants.

## History at [[wood-duck-meadows]]

First sighted along [[the-dam]] bank closest to house in April 2025. Two small examples became evident when they flowered. This was not long after ex-Cyclone Alfred and some additional wet weather. Perhaps brought in by road runoff coming into [[the-dam]].
