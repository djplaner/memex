South-african ornamental garden plant that is considered a significant environmental weed in South-East Queensland. Shrub or small tree to 3m. [Ochna Serrulata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ochna_serrulata) is also known as Mickey Mouse Plant due to the shape of its fruit.

Can take a bit to [kill off Ochna Serrulata](https://weeds.org.au/profiles/ochna-mickey-mouse/) as it can comeback after mechanical and chemical control. In SE Queensland seeds are spread by fig birds (e.g.  [Australasian Figbird](/memex/sense/birdwatching/australasianFigbird.md))

Small plants can be dug out with the focus on taking out as much of the tap root as possible to prevent re-sprouting. Larger plants will likely require [[regeneration-techniques#cut-and-paint|cut and paint]].
