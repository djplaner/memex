[Crassocephalum crepidioides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crassocephalum_crepidioides) is a naturalised weed in Australia that is present in many tropical/sub-tropical regions. A tall annual herb growing to 1.5m, it has a distinctive red flower head and is often found in disturbed areas, roadsides, and gardens.

First noticed on the bank of the dam near the [[mango-paddock]] in June 2025. In an area that had been previously cleared of weeds.
