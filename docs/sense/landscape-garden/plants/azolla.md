First noticed in 2023/2024 in [[the-dam]] [azolla](https://agriculture.vic.gov.au/farm-management/water/managing-dams/azolla-growth-in-farm-dams) is a small, free-floating fern native to Australia. Under good conditions azolla spreads across a dam surface with the ability to double its surface area within a week. It is able to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere due to hosting nitrogen-fixing bacteria.

## Wood duck meadows

Its first appearance in [[the-dam]] raised some concern, but learning more about it led us to use it as a compost. Echoing somewhat its use as a fertilizer in southeast Asia.

By late 2024 the azolla had disappeared from [[the-dam]]. However, in the warm autumn weather of 2025 in the aftermath of Cyclone Alfred it reappeared in both [[the-dam]] and [[lower-dam]]. This being its first appearance in the [[lower-dam]].
