Melia azedarach (aka white cedar, chinaberry tree) is a deciduous tree that grows to 15m. A spreading canopy and being deciduous during winter make it a popular ornamental tree. Though it's not with out its issues, including most parts of the tree being poisonous, a shortish lifespan, and a potential to become invasive.


## History at [[wood-duck-meadows|Wood duck meadows]]

The invasive tendency is somewhat evident at [[wood-duck-meadows]] with a number of white cedars around the property, including [[orchard-corner]] and the [[front-yard]]. The [[orchard-corner]] white cedar is the most advanced with the following images showing its deciduous nature.
