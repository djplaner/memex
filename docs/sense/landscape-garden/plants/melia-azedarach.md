Melia azedarach (aka white cedar, chinaberry tree) is a deciduous tree that grows to 15m. A spreading canopy and being deciduous during winter make it a popular ornamental tree. Though it's not with out its issues, including most parts of the tree being poisonous, a shortish lifespan, and a potential to become invasive.
