Adding to the numerous fig (ficus) trees on [[wood-duck-meadows]] are a couple sandpaper figs ([[island-sandpaper-fig]]) we planted out in 2024 and 2024.

Wikipedia offers at least three species of sandpaper fig, including:

- [Ficus coronata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ficus_coronata) 
- [Ficus fraseri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ficus_fraseri)
- [Ficus opposita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ficus_opposita)
