Adding to the numerous fig (ficus) trees on [[wood-duck-meadows]] are a couple sandpaper figs ([[island-sandpaper-fig]]) we planted out in 2024 and 2024.

Wikipedia offers at numerous species of [sandpaper fig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandpaper_fig), we have two types on [[wood-duck-meadows]]:

- [[ficus-opposita]] - the sweet sandpaper fig
- ficus coronata - the creek sandpaper fig (not yet documented)
