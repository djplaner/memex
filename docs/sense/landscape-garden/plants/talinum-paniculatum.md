With succulent, shiny leaves not unlike [[madeira-vine]] this native of the Americas was initially confused with [[madeira-vine]] (when small). The plant has tuberous roots and produces panicles of pink flowers (hence the alternate name _pink baby's breath_). It has a long orange root that can be up to 80cm long.

[Some suggest](https://fairdinkumseeds.com/products-page/ethnobotanical-or-medicinal-plants/jewels-of-opar-talinum-paniculatum-babies-breath-seeds/) it has benefits including drought tolerance, leaves that can be eaten in various ways, and historical use as a medicinal plant. However, it self-seeds readily and can be invasive, especially in moister areas. Hence considered by some as a [weed to whack](https://sown.com.au/talinum-paniculatum-portulacaceae-pink-baby-breath-jewels-of-opar/). A task which can prove difficult with its tuberous roots.
