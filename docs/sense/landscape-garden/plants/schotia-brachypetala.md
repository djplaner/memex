A medium to large tree to 20 meters. Native to Africa below the Zambezi river. Perhaps most well-known in Australia due to the [intoxication of lorikeets](https://www.australiangeographic.com.au/topics/wildlife/2011/10/drunk-birds-inebriation-in-the-wild/) that result when they feed on the red flowers of the tree. 

## Wood duck meadows

Probably the most invasive tree found on [[wood-duck-meadows]] with numerous big trees and saplings found at the [[roundabout]], along [[the-dam]] and, on [[the-island]].
