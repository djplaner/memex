Home since 2012. Property was historically used for small scale farming/market garden before being broken up into smaller lots. Our block being the original homestead and the largest at 10 acres. 

More recently largely used as for horse paddocks. Closer to the house being planted with many different ornamental/non-native trees and plants (e.g. [[agave]]). More recently many areas have been increasingly over grown with various weeds (e.g. climbing asparagus fern ([[asparagus-africanus]]), lantana, [[madeira-vine]], [[cats-claw-creeper]] etc).

Our plan is to regenerate the place (re-)developing various regionally [appropriate habitat types](https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/plants-animals/habitats/habitat). An initial possible list including: [Eucalypt woodlands](https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/plants-animals/habitats/habitat/eucalypt-woodlands), [Brigalow scrub](https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/plants-animals/habitats/habitat/brigalow), and [dry rainforest](https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/plants-animals/habitats/habitat/dry-rainforest). Perhaps with a particular focus on [semi-evergreen vine thickets (aka dry rainforest)](https://apps.des.qld.gov.au/regional-ecosystems/details/?re=12.8.21)

The [[house]] is also undergoing a regeneration to be more appropriate to the changing context.

### State of the region

[Healthy Land & Water](https://www.hlw.org.au/region/about/natural-assets/nature#gsc.tab=0) provides statistics showing a decline in vegetation across the broader south-east Queensland region since 2001, including:

- Losses of 7,384 hectares of remnant vegation, 54,983 hectares of woody vegetation, and 1,220 hectares of natural wetlands.
- Fragmentation of remaining vegetation tracts.


## To do

1. Plant categorisation and selection

    - Categories of plans (top layer, ground cover etc)
    - Improvements to soil
    - Companion plants to fig tree

2. Process for working on a berm (and other areas)

3. Clearing 

    - [ ] Remove pepper/parrot trees from round about
    - [ ] Work on clearing existing macadamia tree.
    - [ ] Finish clearing the southern bank of [[the-dam]]
