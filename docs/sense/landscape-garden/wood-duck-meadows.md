Home block since 2011. Originally used for small scale framing before being broken up into smaller lots. Ours being the original homestead and the largest block at 10 acres. More recently largely used as a horse meadows with many different non-native trees and plants. Increasingly over grown with various weeds like aspargus fern, lantana,  madiera vine etc.

Plan is to "rewild" the place (re-)developing various regionally [appropriate habitat types](https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/plants-animals/habitats/habitat). An initial possible list including: [Eucalypt woodlands](https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/plants-animals/habitats/habitat/eucalypt-woodlands), [Brigalow scrub](https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/plants-animals/habitats/habitat/brigalow), and [dry rainforest](https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/plants-animals/habitats/habitat/dry-rainforest)

## Zones

| [[brigalow-scrub]] | A small stand at the front of the property |
| [[rocky-creek-frontage]] | Gatton Creek frontage to the east of the round about |
| [[fig-tree-berm]] | Pre-existing berm near the bunker |
| [[lower-dam]] | Dam area on the Gatton creek frontage |
| [[orchard-corner]] | A nascent grove at the southern end of the property | 
| [[pecan-corner]] | Pecan and other fruit/nut trees |
| [[roundabout]] | Long established lawn and path |

| [[gatton-creek-frontage]] | Gatton Creek frontage to the west of the round about |

## Measurement

### Tools and external projects

List of projects/tools to help with various forms of measurement of what we're doing.

- Sketch up may be useful for mapping/planning.
- eBird for bird observations - see [[life-list]]
- [BioCollect](https://www.ala.org.au/biocollect/) from the [Atlas of Living Australia](https://www.ala.org.au/) or related [iNaturalist Australia](https://inaturalist.ala.org.au/)
- Qld government
    - [Regrowth benefits interactive map](https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/plants-animals/habitats/regrowth/regrowth-mapping) - part of a re-growing native forest site, including [regrowth management guides](https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/plants-animals/habitats/regrowth/regrowth-guides)

## To do

1. Plant categorisation and selection

    - Categories of plans (top layer, ground cover etc)
    - Improvements to soil
    - Companion plants to fig tree
    - Identify the other big tree on [[fig-tree-berm]]

2. Process for working on a berm
