Home block since 2011. Originally used for small scale farming/market garden before being broken up into smaller lots. Ours being the original homestead and the largest block at 10 acres. More recently largely used as a horse meadows with closer to the house being planted with many different non-native trees and plants (e.g. [[agave]]). More recently many areas have been increasingly over grown with various weeds (e.g. aspargus fern, lantana, [[madeira-vine]], [[cats-claw-creeper]] etc).

Plan is to "rewild" the place (re-)developing various regionally [appropriate habitat types](https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/plants-animals/habitats/habitat). An initial possible list including: [Eucalypt woodlands](https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/plants-animals/habitats/habitat/eucalypt-woodlands), [Brigalow scrub](https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/plants-animals/habitats/habitat/brigalow), and [dry rainforest](https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/plants-animals/habitats/habitat/dry-rainforest). Perhaps with a particular focus on [semi-evergreen vine thickets](https://apps.des.qld.gov.au/regional-ecosystems/details/?re=12.8.21)

## Measurement

### Tools and external projects

List of projects/tools to help with various forms of measurement of what we're doing.

- Sketch up may be useful for mapping/planning.
- eBird for bird observations - see [[life-list]]
- [BioCollect](https://www.ala.org.au/biocollect/) from the [Atlas of Living Australia](https://www.ala.org.au/) or related [iNaturalist Australia](https://inaturalist.ala.org.au/)

### State of the region

[Healthy Land & Water](https://www.hlw.org.au/region/about/natural-assets/nature#gsc.tab=0) provides statistics showing a decline in vegetation across the broader south-east Queensland region since 2001, including:

- Losses of 7,384 hectares of remnant vegation, 54,983 hectares of woody vegetation, and 1,220 hectares of natural wetlands.
- Fragmentation of remaining vegetation tracts.


## To do

1. Plant categorisation and selection

    - Categories of plans (top layer, ground cover etc)
    - Improvements to soil
    - Companion plants to fig tree
    - Identify the other big tree on [[fig-tree-berm]]

2. Process for working on a berm
