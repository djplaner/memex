Home since 2012. Property was historically used for small scale farming/market garden before being broken up into smaller lots. Our block being the original homestead and the largest at 10 acres. 

More recently largely used as for horse paddocks. Closer to the house being planted with many different ornamental/non-native trees and plants (e.g. [[agave]]). More recently many areas have been increasingly over grown with various weeds (e.g. [[asparagus-africanus|climbing asparagus fern]], lantana, [[madeira-vine]], [[cats-claw-creeper]] etc).

We're slowly engaging in bush [[regeneration]] to bring back various regionally [appropriate habitat types](https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/plants-animals/habitats/habitat). 

The [[house]] is also undergoing a regeneration to be more appropriate to the changing context.

## Position

The property is located in western side of the Lockyer Valley, Queensland. In the region of Postman's Ridge.

- [Lockyer Valley Catchment Story](https://qgsp.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=e64a7303aff74f2e83454e6baf35651a)

    Queensland Government part of a series providing details on SE Qld catchments. **Look more into this**

Potential regional ecosystem types:

- [12.9-10.15](https://apps.des.qld.gov.au/regional-ecosystems/details/?re=12.9-10.15) Semi-evergreen vine thicket with Narrow-leaved bottle trees on sedimentary rocks (part of softwood scrub) - but not a wetland.

    Common trees: narrow-leaved bottle tree ([[brachychiton-rupestris]]), Crows Ash (Flindersia australis), Rosewood (Acaia fasciculifera) and small-leaved fig ([[ficus-obliqua]])

    The sedimentary rocks are soft and easily weathered and form loamy to light clay soils.

    Often co-occurs with RE 12.9-10.6 Brigalow (Acacia hapophylla). Softwood scrub species may also establish in some adjacent types of Eucalyptus woodland in the absence of fire.

- [12.8.21 Semi-evergreen vine thicket](https://apps.des.qld.gov.au/regional-ecosystems/details/?re=12.8.21) with Brachychiton rupestris on Cainozoic igneous rocks

Land types ([Lockyer Valley](https://www.hlw.org.au/resources/downloads/seq-land-types/223-land-type-booklet-lockyer-catchment/file)):

- Riparian forests - Narrow strips along creeks/rivers
- Softwood vine scrub

    More on mid to upper slopes of rolling and steep hills. Hoop pine, crow's ash. Some soils are shallow dark, clay loams, but typically friable well drained loamy soils that are brown, yellowish/reddish brown

## Zones

To aid discussion and planning we're slowly dividing the property into the different zones list in the following table.

| Zone | Description |

| [[gatton-creek-frontage]] | Creek frontage to the west of the round about |
| [[cherry-tree-walk]] | Path along the front berm lined with cherry trees |
| [[front-yard]] | Semi-open area between the house the front entrance |
| [[mango-paddock]] | South-western paddock now with two mango trees |
| [[the-island]] | The island in [[the-dam]] |
| [[the-dam]] | Surrounds [[the-island]] and fed by road run-off |
| [[roundabout]] | Long established lawn and path |
| [[rocky-creek-frontage]] | Creek frontage to the east of the round about |
| [[house]] | House, stables, sheds and surrounding gardens |
| [[pecan-corner]] | Pecan and other fruit/nut trees |
| [[lower-dam]] | Dam area on the Gatton creek frontage |
| [[vegetable-beds]] | Our foray into vegetable gardening located just above the [[lower-dam]] |
| [[orchard-corner]] | A nascent grove at the southern end of the property | 
| [[horse-paddock]] | The largest cleared space on the property that used to form the main horse paddock. Contains the [[the-circle]]. |
| [[the-circle]] | Small collection of trees in the middle of the main horse paddock |
| [[fig-tree-berm]] | Pre-existing berm near the bunker |
| The [[bunker]] | Small building and the area in front of it in the north-eastern corner of the property |
| [[back-corner]] | The far north-eastern corner of the property (the least visited part) |

## Measurement

### Tools and external projects

List of projects/tools to help with various forms of measurement of what we're doing.

- Sketch up may be useful for mapping/planning.
- eBird for bird observations - see [life-list](../birdwatching/life-list.md)
- [BioCollect](https://www.ala.org.au/biocollect/) from the [Atlas of Living Australia](https://www.ala.org.au/) or related [iNaturalist Australia](https://inaturalist.ala.org.au/)

### State of the region

[Healthy Land & Water](https://www.hlw.org.au/region/about/natural-assets/nature#gsc.tab=0) provides statistics showing a decline in vegetation across the broader south-east Queensland region since 2001, including:

- Losses of 7,384 hectares of remnant vegation, 54,983 hectares of woody vegetation, and 1,220 hectares of natural wetlands.
- Fragmentation of remaining vegetation tracts.

## To do

1. Plant categorisation and selection

    - Categories of plans (top layer, ground cover etc)
    - Improvements to soil
    - Companion plants to fig tree

2. Process for working on a berm (and other areas)

3. Clearing 

    - [ ] Remove pepper/parrot trees from round about
    - [ ] Work on clearing existing macadamia tree.
    - [ ] Finish clearing the southern bank of [[the-dam]]
