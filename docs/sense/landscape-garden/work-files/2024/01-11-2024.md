Removal of a long section of [[agave]] that had taken over the top of the creek bank. From a positive perspective, the agave has probably slowed down the spread of lantana and [[madeira-vine]]. 

Work started early November 2024 with the initial [[agave]] removal completed on Xmas day 2024.

Follow up to continue. Will also need to remove more agave further down the creek bank.
