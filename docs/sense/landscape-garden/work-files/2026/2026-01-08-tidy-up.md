Earlier work in this location had cleared out a bunch of [[agave]], other larger weeds, and Jacaranda branches leaving a couple of piles. The passing of time has seen the [[megathyrsus-maximus|green panic]] and a bit of [[asparagus-africanus]] get a bit out of control.

 The quality of the soil meant a fair bit of the green panic was pulled, rather than cut.
