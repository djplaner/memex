The [[megathyrsus-maximus]] in the [[gatton-creek-frontage]] has taken off given time, rain, and heat.

Spent a few ours over two days reducing it with the weed-eater and only accidentally taking out one small sapling. Also had to collect a couple of [[araucaria-bidwillii]] (Bunya pine) cones that had fallen in the area, and removing some [[asparagus-africanus]]. Hand pull a bit of Agave re-growth.
