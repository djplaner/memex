Continuing work from last week on clearing the [[rocky-creek-frontage]] boundary near the house. 
Started with the brush cutter to deal with some [[megathyrsus-maximus]] followed with removing the old fencing wire. From here able to get just across the fence line (but not our boundary) to attach some [[anredera-cordifolia]] (pulled out a full bag), [[asparagus-africanus]] and lantana.
