Some [tiger pear](https://weeds.org.au/profiles/tiger-pear-jointed/) had been spotted near the front gate and throughout the [[brigalow-scrub]] area. Spent a little time in the afternoon looking for all the little outbursts of it spread throughout the area. Most likely from mowing in the area, because Tiger Pear can re-grow from any small piece of the stem.

Also spotted/dealt with some Woolyjoint Pricklypear, Heart-leaf Ice Plant, [[asparagus-africanus]] and Winter Apple.
