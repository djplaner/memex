Last bit of work on the Rocky Creek Frontage next the [[lower-dam]] identified a fair a bit of [[asparagus-africanus]] regrowth. Coming back after significant work in 2024. Today's work was originally to remove the regrowth, but quickly identified some additional work. There was a fair bit of Brazillian Nightshade to be removed, and I discovered another [[schinus-terebinthifolia]] tree and a [[leucaena-leucocephala]] tree.

Most of this work was occurring under the cover of much taller trees. Making for a nicer shady work space. It also meant that there was a lot of leaf litter. Some of it quite deep. Deep enough for the [[asparagus-africanus]] to take full advantage

After the above, I moved to the part of the Rocky Creek Frontage in front of the house to remove some old wire fencing. Part of the on-going task for cleaning up this section of the boundary.
