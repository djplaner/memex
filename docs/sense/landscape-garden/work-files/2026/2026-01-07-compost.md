The current compost heaps have been sitting idle for some time. 

The most left hand bay contained some [[madeira-vine]] after its use in [[weed-tea]]. Left on its own in case there was some regrowth (there was a tiny bit). The next bay contained some [[agave]] leaves and misc other waste. The [[agave]] had been composting for quite some time and was becoming very soil like.

Both these bays were combined into the left-most bay with some additional dead [[madeira-vine]] added. The well composted [[agave]] forming the top layer.

The only right-hand bay being used was full with mostly the remains of [[asparagus-africanus|climbing asparagus fern]] which hadn't been cut up, hence it wasn't very composted. The contents was moved to the other right-hand bay and chomped into smaller pieces,
