Continuing work clearing the creek area below the roundabout. A main bit of work was removing a [[schinus-terebinthifolia]] tree that due to floods was - like many of the trees at this level - over on its side and continuing to grow. Lots of [[anredera-cordifolia]] and [[dolichandra-unguis-cati]] along with a bit of [[megathyrsus-maximus]] and [[asparagus-africanus]].

Also necessary to reduce and remove previously cut down [[schinus-terebinthifolia]] and [[gleditsia-triacanthos]] trunks.

Did discover a mature [[casimiroa-edulis]] (white sapote) tree.
