Another week, another round of weed tea. First quite warm day of spring/summer.

Most of the [[weed-tea]] applied to the new trees Sandy has planted in the [[front-yard]]. For example, the following.

Next were the eponymous trees along the [[cherry-tree-walk]]. The numerous weeds suggesting another required job.
