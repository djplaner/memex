With a period of humid and hot days with regular storms the grass and weeds across the place have grown rapidly. Especially problematic on the edge of the [[gatton-creek-frontage]] where we've planted new trees, shrubs etc. As illustrated in the following photo.

So work carried out on the 26th and 29th November involved removing a lot of [[megathyrsus-maximus|Guinea grass]], [[madeira-vine]] and misc. other weeds were removed leaving a clearer path.

Whilst doing this work there was a visit from one of the locals. The first Australian Water Dragon I've seen and been able to photograph at home.
