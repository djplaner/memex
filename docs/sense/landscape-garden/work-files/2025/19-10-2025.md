Dry weather means that [[the-dam]] has started to dry up and [[the-island]] is accessible again without having to remove shoes etc.

Before heading over to [[the-island]] I pulled an [[ochna-serrulata]] (Mickey Mouse plant) on [[the-dam]] bank.

Once on [[the-island]] the focus was some follow up clearing of [[megathyrsus-maximus]], [[madeira-vine]], and [[asparagus-africanus]]. The [[megathyrsus-maximus]] being the most prevalent. Today was a small start done without sufficient (any) sunburn cream.
