Turned the content of the two compost bins into their neighbouring bins. 

The right-hand bin containing mostly agave leaves with misc. other ingredients is decomposing nicely. Many of the agave leaves are still vaguely recognisable, but very brown having lost most of their moisture. A good mixing of humus within it all.

The left-hand bin is mostly [[asparagus-africanus]] recently pulled, including some new stuff taken from just below [[pecan-corner]]. Some decomposition but given the relative freshness of the material and the nature of quite "woody" asparagus fern, not as far along as the other bin.
