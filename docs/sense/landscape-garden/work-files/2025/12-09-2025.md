Moving further up the creek, but still near [[pecan-corner]]. Tidying up [[asparagus-africanus]] and lantana around another small [[corymbia-torelliana]] tree that looked like this.

But after a few hours we got to this, hopefully the citrus will thrive a little more because of the additional sunlight they should get.
