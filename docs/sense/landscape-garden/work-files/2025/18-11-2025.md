title: Clearing the roundabout's path

The path around the top of the roundabout had become overgrown with a variety of weeds (e.g. American and Brazilian Nightshade, amongst many others). A tree we thought might be a Privet finally started to flower which enabled a firmer confirmation through iNaturalist - it was a privet.

Before the cleaning.

Initial path clearing started yesterday (17 Nov 2025). Simple manual removal made somewhat easier due to recent rain and moisture in the soil. Today's task was cutting down the privet and poisoning the stump. Before that it was necessary to remove some [[madeira-vine]] and [[cats-claw-creeper]] regrowth on the slope below the privet.

A pile of the pulled weeds is to the left in the foreground. Along both sides of the path there appears to be three or four largish weeds encroaching onto the path. These are actually the random cherry tomato plants that have sprung up after deposits from local birds (we assume).
