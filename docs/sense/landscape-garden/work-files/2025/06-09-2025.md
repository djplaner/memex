Finishing up work started yesterday tidying up the [[corymbia-torelliana]] tree that sits just outside the fence from [[pecan-corner]]. 

First step was chopping up and removing branches from the tree that had been cut down previously. You can see those in the foreground of the following picture. The [[corymbia-torelliana]] tree is in the background.

Once the branches were out of the way some remaining lantana and [[asparagus-africanus]] could be removed from around the base of the tree. Finally, the regrowth of the tree were cut down and left to decompose. The aim here is to "harvest" these branches every couple of years for use as foundations for garden beds and foundations for tree planting. The following image shows the end result.
