Increasingly a problem for us is identifying and tracking plants on our property. The question is how we do it?

## Examples 


### Physical signage

[FEP's microforest project](https://fep.org.au/projects/microforest-project/) has a summary of their work creating "Botanical Plant Signs" (Sep 20, 2025). These are FEP branded signs with naming, description and images of the plants. Included are QR codes that link back to the [FEP plants page](https://fep.org.au/plants/).

[Plant tagging solutions](https://www.lfwseq.org.au/plant-tagging-solutions/) article from a Land for Wildlife member detailing here experience. Aluminium tags failed due to birds stealing the shiny object. Plastic tags deteriorated in the open. Ceramic tiles with paint pens for labelling failed due to be lost in leaf litter. Final solution was vinyl plank offcuts (good quality thick vinyl) using oil-based paint pens (Sharpie brand lasts longest). The plank is firmly attached to thick wire legs and inserted into the ground. Placing the plank facing to the south to reduce fading.

### Digital signage

An early experiment with geotagging suggested that the precision of GPS on phones is not sufficient.
