title: Bush regeneration (Wood duck meadows)
type: note
---
Nascent work on bush regeneration (aka [[ecosystem-restoration]]) of [[wood-duck-meadows]]. Was originally labelled gardens, but we're not really gardening. Rather trying to restore the bush on our 10 acre block.

## Our approach

Still in the early days, but our approach will not be straight [[ecosystem-restoration]]. It will include insights from [[permaculture]] and [[permaculture-principles]]. In particular, the idea of obtaining a yield. For example, the planning of fruit trees that aren't native (e.g. [[mango-nam-doc-mai]], [[loquat-lower-dam]]).

Any approach should be appropriate to the context.

### Our context

[[wood-duck-meadows]] is located within the Lockyer Valley. There are a number of [regionally appropriate habitat types](https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/plants-animals/habitats/habitat) that we may be looking to regenerate/develop, including

- [Eucalypt woodlands](https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/plants-animals/habitats/habitat/eucalypt-woodlands), 

    The [[gatton-creek-frontage]] zone is almost a Eucalypt woodland now. Given its size, [[the-circle]] zone might be a candidate for this habitat type. 

- [Brigalow scrub](https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/plants-animals/habitats/habitat/brigalow), and 

    The [[brigalow-scrub]] zone is a small but well established example. We're unlikely to significantly expand this habitat type, but we definitely wish to retain and strengthen its.

- [dry rainforest](https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/plants-animals/habitats/habitat/dry-rainforest) and [semi-evergreen vine thickets (aka dry rainforest)](https://apps.des.qld.gov.au/regional-ecosystems/details/?re=12.8.21).

    There are dry rainforest trees spread across the property, including: [[bunya-pine]], hoop pines; [[macadamia]] trees; [[harpullia-pendula]] (Tulipwoods); numerous fig trees of different species (e.g. [[unknown-ficus]]); and, some [[brachychiton-rupestris]]].

    Broad stages in the process of bush regeneration. Stages that are visible in different approaches and which are implemented using various different techniques. Common stages might include:

    - Reducing invasive species.
    - Mitigating weeds and erosion.
    - Replanting and introducing species.
    - [[improving-soil]].
