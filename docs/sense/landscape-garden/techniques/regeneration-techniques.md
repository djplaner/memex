## Weed control

### Cut and paint

1. Cut the stem/plant horizontally as close to the ground as possible.
2. Immediately apply herbicide to the cut surface.
3. If regrowth, cut and paint shoots after sufficient regrowth.

### Drilling

1. Drill 45 degree angle holes into the base of the stem of healthy and growing plants with 5cm separation.
2. Immediately fill the holes with herbicide.
