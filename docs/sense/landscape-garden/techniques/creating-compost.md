How to speed up the process of decomposing organic matter into compost.

## Compost at [[wood-duck-meadows]]

### Design

Our first larger scale attempt is inspired by the [Weedy Gardner's approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV_kkJy3s3Q&) and reusing existing materials on the property. Four meter by one meter bays with walls formed by galvanised iron sheets kept in place by star pickets. Required components are:

- 2 x 4 meter galvanised iron sheets
- 5 x 1 meter galvanised iron sheets
- 17 star pickets
- a bunch of wire, and
- the browns and greens.

Breaking down large molecules (Proteins, DNA, starch) to smaller molecules (amino acids, nucleotides, sugars) to make them available to microbes.

Size does matter. Size of the pile and of the components that go into it. Smaller - cut up - pieces have more surface area.


### [Composting 101](https://www.nrdc.org/stories/composting-101)

Considerations for composting at home

- Availability of space
- How much organic waste you produce
- What kind of organic waste
- Amount of time available for composting

Two kinds of backyard composting

1. cold/passive composting

    Let it happen. Minimal effort, takes longer - up to two years. Not likely to get hot enough to kill pathogens and weed seeds.
2. hot/active composting

    Requires attention to ratio of carbon/nitrogen. Time required from four weeks to 12 months.

Ingredients - ratio 2-4 parts brown:1 part green

- Nitrogen - greens

    Fresh grass clippings, vegetable scraps, fruit scraps, coffee grounds, eggshells, manure

- Carbon - browns

    Dried leaves, straw, shredded paper, cardboard, sawdust

Layer materials (which are in small pieces, no thicker than a finger) with alternate layers for green and brown. Keeping as moist as a wrung-out sponge. Aerate the pile by turning it regularly (3-7 days)

Meter cubed piles are best. 1 cubic meter is the minimum size for a hot compost pile. Smaller piles will not heat up enough to kill pathogens and weed seeds.

### [How to compost effectively](https://www.detsi.qld.gov.au/our-department/news-media/down-to-earth/how-to-compost-effectively)

Location - flat, well-drained, semi-shaded, not near the house, access to water, access to plants/garden, 

Start with layer of small twigs, old mulch or potting mix for air flow. Alternate green and brown layers. Ratio of two brown to one green.

    Focus on building 1 cubic meter piles. Shows physical setup. Components and turning every 2 days.
