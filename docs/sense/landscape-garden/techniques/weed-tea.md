Placing weeds in a bucket of water to use fermentation to create a nutrient-rich liquid fertiliser.

!!! note "An absence of empirical evidence?"

    A lot of online resource promote weed teas, but provide little empirical evidence. At least one person has argued against use of weed teas. However, personal anecdotal evidence suggests some benefit.

    Perhaps a key issue is the specifics. What weeds are used? What else is being done in the garden?

## Process

Creation

- Fill bucket 2/3 full with weeds
- Fill with water
- Leave for a week or two

Use

- Filter/strain the liquid
- Dilute with water (1:10)
- Pour over root zone of growing plants
