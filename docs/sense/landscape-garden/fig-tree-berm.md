Fig tree berm is a pre-existing berm located near the bunker. The site for early explorations into food forest design.

    Two rounds of initial clearing undertaken to clear out ground cover weeds. Plans what to do incomplete.

## Site

Heavy clay soil with two existing trees

1. Cadaghi ([[corymbia-torelliana]])
2. Fig tree

In a decent rain the berm will have standing water for sometime.

## Early planning

Was initially leaning toward [[leucaena-leucocephala]] as the pioneer plant. It grows locally (in the neighbouring creek), is a nitrogen fixer, puts down a serious tap root (opening up soil), and will be used as a chop and drop plant.
