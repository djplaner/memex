    Two rounds of initial clearing undertaken to clear out ground cover weeds. Plans what to do incomplete.

## Site

Heavy clay soil with two existing trees

1. Cadaghi ([[corymbia-torelliana]])
2. Fig tree

In a decent rain the berm will have standing water for sometime.

## Early planning

Was initially leaning toward [[leucaena-leucocephala]] as the pioneer plant. It grows locally (in the neighbouring creek), is a nitrogen fixer, puts down a serious tap root (opening up soil), and will be used as a chop and drop plant.
