Slowly learning that there a numerous methods and as expected various controversies between proponents. All apparently related to different contexts or perspectives adopted by the different methods.

Bush regeneration has a Wikipedia page suggesting it is an Australian term for "ecological restoration of remnant vegetation areas" with the aim 

> to restore and maintain ecosystem health by facilitating the natural regeneration of indigenous flora

Goosem and Tucker (2013) explain it this way

> The most fundamental restoration goal, therefore, is to recover species composition and structure and to return damaged ecosystems to some set of conditions considered functional, sustainable and natural.

A task that can include 

- Reducing invasive species.
- Mitigating weeds and erosion.
- Replanting and introducing species.

## Methods etc

May different approaches to this task have been developed, the following outlines some.

- [[ten-golden-rules-for-restoring-forests]]

### Bradley Method

Arising from work in the early 1960s by the Bradley sisters (see [Wikipedia for more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_regeneration#Bradley_method)). Further experience suggests this approach very successful for the original context, but less successful in different contexts (e.g. dry rainforest). 

Suggests three principles

1. Always work from good to bad areas.

    Removing weeds from a good area and moving out.
2. Disturb the soil as little as possible and restore it to its natural condition .

    Weed removal should be done by hand. Replacing soil, leaf litter etc as you go.
3. Allow the rate of regeneration to dictate the rate of clearing.

    Limit clearing until natives are starting to poke through. Don't seek to leave large amounts of cleared area for weeds to return.

### Wingham Brush Method

Developed as part of restoration of the [Wingham Brush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingham_Brush_Nature_Reserve) after observation that the [Bradley Method](#bradley-method) - developed in Sydney  - was not the best fit for the rainforest environment.

1. Soil stabilisation

    e.g. swales etc

2. Water infiltration
3. Pioneer species

    Tough species that can grow in harsh conditions

4. Ecological succession

    Process of moving from "bare rock" to "climax community". Assumption is that nature moves toward greater complexity. First three steps seek to trigger this process.

A "climax community" is context dependent. 

### Revegetation guide for sub-tropical forest

Greening Australia (n.d.) provides a revegetation guide for sub-tropical rainforest. 

1. Assess site conditions 
2. Set clear revegetation objectives
3. Carefully select and source your plants
4. Site preparation
5. Planting
6. Monitoring and maintenance

Stages of sub-tropical rainforest succession (succession - process of natural regeneration in sub-tropical rainforest)

- Pioneer to early secondary species

    Require sun to germinate and survive, generally quick growing, and have a relatively short life span. Condition a site for latter species by improving soil and forming a temporary canopy. These species predominantly make up the soil seed reserves of a rainforest.

- Late secondary species

    More shad tolerant, slower growing, and longer lived.

- Mature phase

    Form the canopy of mature rainforest. Seeds are usually very short lived but can germinate and live in a suppressed state in the understorey. Will fill small gaps.

Planting models

- Late succession planting for isolated sites

    Using a diversity of mature and secondary phase tree species.

- Early successional planting for sites adjacent to rainforest patches

    Predominantly tall and fast growing (shade tolerant) species from pioneer and early secondary phases. Only a few mature phase tress.

- Pioneer plantings for exposed sites

    Single or mixed species of pioneer plants.

Reports that the Big Scrub Rainforest Landcare Group suggest spacing trees at 1.8m as most effective

### Rainforest restoration manual for south-eastern Australia

Peel (2010) uses a 10 steps for rainforest restoration

1. Was it ever rainforest? 
2. What type of rainforest was it? 
3. What does the site need for rainforest to recover? 
4. Can you actually do it or do you need expert help? 
5. What rainforest restoration methods are needed? 
6. What resources and money are needed for rainforest restoration? 
7. Site plans, a project management plan and a project calendar 
8. Project implementation 
9. How to measure success? 
10. What resources are needed to maintain the restored rainforest?

And a hierarchy of goals and actions to manage rainforest that is broken into two phases

1. Emergency management - identify the threats and deal with them.

    Goal is to protecting existing rainforest remnants, including starting on steps 3-7. Treats include 

    - Loss of existing stands (e.g. logging)
    - weed invasion
    - habitat loss/change
    - grazing/browsing
    - inappropriate fire regimes

2. Recovery - enhance, restore, extend, and re-connect your rainforest.

    Goals include

    - repair and extend existing rainforest remnants
    - connect or recreate missing remnant islands 
    - Recreate new stands in more isolated areas 
    - Monitor your results

Four rainforest restoration methods are identified as used in south-eastern Australia

1. Natural regeneration method - release ecological brakes and allow the remnant regenerate naturally. For sites with good context.
2. Framework restoration method - for sites with good context, but degraded vegetation. Use of pioneer and secondary species with on-going monitoring.
3. Maximum diversity method - poor condition and context, plant all necessary components to make up for missing seedbank.

    - aims to establish functioning rainforest in 3-5 years
    - aims to extinguish most weeds during establishment
    - aims to restore as much of the original plant species diversity (50% or more)
    - uses a staged approach known as _successional planting_
    - primary & secondary planting combined with integrated weed management
4. Clumped mixed canopy method - islands/clumps of canopy species are planted within protective unpalatable vegetation where there's already abundant native ground cover and perhaps if browsing pressure is high.

Plant choices

- Niche is paramount - e.g. guidelines regarding lite and shade
- Observe plants growing locally
- Begin planting in the season just before active growth would begin in nature

| Measure | Criteria | Audience or use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Habitat value for birds | Number of bird species, types of bird species, birds not yet present | Guide restoration works; assess the level of success |
| Leaf litter | Litter-dependent birds, litter-dependent moths | Assess level of success; and knowledge that ecosystem function is beginning to return |
| Natural regeneration | Number of species regenerating, types of species regenerating, abundance of species' regeneration | Helps guide restoration; assess level of success; |
