Slowly learning that there a numerous methods and as expected various controversies between proponents. All apparently related to different contexts or perspectives adopted by the different methods.

Bush regeneration has a Wikipedia page suggesting it is an Australian term for "ecological restoration of remnant vegetation areas" with the aim 

> to restore and maintain ecosystem health by facilitating the natural regeneration of indigenous flora

A task that can include 

- Reducing invasive species.
- Mitigating weeds and erosion.
- Replanting and introducing species.

## Bradley Method

Arising from work in the early 1960s by the Bradley sisters (see [Wikipedia for more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_regeneration#Bradley_method)). Further experience suggests this approach very successful for the original context, but less successful in different contexts (e.g. dry rainforest). 

Suggests three principles

1. Always work from good to bad areas.

    Removing weeds from a good area and moving out.
2. Disturb the soil as little as possible and restore it to its natural condition .

    Weed removal should be done by hand. Replacing soil, leaf litter etc as you go.
3. Allow the rate of regeneration to dictate the rate of clearing.

    Limit clearing until natives are starting to poke through. Don't seek to leave large amounts of cleared area for weeds to return.


## Wingham Brush Method

Developed as part of restoration of the [Wingham Brush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingham_Brush_Nature_Reserve) after observation that the [Bradley Method](#bradley-method) - developed in Sydney  - was not the best fit for the rainforest environment.

1. Soil stabilisation

    e.g. swales etc

2. Water infiltration
3. Pioneer species

    Tough species that can grow in harsh conditions

4. Ecological succession

    Process of moving from "bare rock" to "climax community". Assumption is that nature moves toward greater complexity. First three steps seek to trigger this process.

A "climax community" is context dependent.
