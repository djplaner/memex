## The Bradley Method

Suggests three principles

1. Always work from good to bad areas.

    Removing weeds from a good area and moving out.
2. Disturb the soil as little as possible and restore it to its natural condition .

    Weed removal should be done by hand. Replacing soil, leaf litter etc as you go.
3. Allow the rate of regeneration to dictate the rate of clearing.

    Limit clearing until natives are starting to poke through. Don't seek to leave large amounts of cleared area for weeds to return.

1. Soil stabilisation

    e.g. swales etc

2. Water infiltration
3. Pioneer species

    Tough species that can grow in harsh conditions

4. Ecological succession

    Process of moving from "bare rock" to "climax community". Assumption is that nature moves toward greater complexity. First three steps seek to trigger this process.

A "climax community" is context dependent.
