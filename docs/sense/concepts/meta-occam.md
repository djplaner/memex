David Krakauer from [episode on Jim Rutt Show](https://jimruttshow.blubrry.net/the-jim-rutt-show-transcripts/transcript-of-ep-192-david-krakauer-on-science-complexity-and-ai/)

Occam's razor first introduced as a heuristic, not a rule. Described as 

> One should not advocate or generate a plurality without necessity

Used widely in physical sciences etc i.e. be parsimonious. But in a complex world/system there are a lot of dimensions. Being parsimonious about a complex object is difficulty and perhaps problematic. However, natural selection, for example is a fairly simple process that can explain very complex objects. A worm as well as an elephant.

Meta-Occam moves "parsimony away from the primary object of scrutiny...to a process which is minimal, but which can generate arbitrarily complicated objects"

## Early ramblings/wonderings

Echoes of the process, not product focus from my early work.
