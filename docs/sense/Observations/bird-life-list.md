A [life list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_list) is a list of all the species of a specific flora/fauna you've observed. The following is my bird life list gathered through the [[wood-duck-observations]] method. Mostly, these will be observed at [[wood-duck-meadows]], but some may be from elsewhere. 

I currently have three life lists: [[plant-life-list]], [[bird-life-list]] and [[other-fauna-life-list]].
