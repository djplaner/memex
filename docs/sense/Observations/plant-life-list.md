A [life list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_list) is simply some sort of list of all the species of flora/fauna you've observed. The following is a list of all the plants I've observed through iNaturalist. Mostly, these will be plants observed at [[wood-duck-meadows]], but some may be from elsewhere.
