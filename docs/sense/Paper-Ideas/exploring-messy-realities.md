title: Exploring the Messy Realities of Post-Digital Education
---
## Background

Fawns (2019, p. 138)
> Developing more effective pedagogies will require new understandings of how digital technology is intertwined within other aspects of the spaces in which students and teachers act. Rather than looking to "identify the impediments and deficiencies that are delaying and opposing the march of technological progress" (Selwyn 2010: 69), it may be more beneficial to help teachers and students develop and embed new practices in contex- tually appropriate ways, while recognising and examining the "messy realities" (Selwyn 2010: 70) of technology-related practice.

- Universities want to spread "digital education"
- Historically little adoption has happened and where it has it hasn't changed practice of teachers
- The post-digital lens suggests that this is because little attention is paid to the context (e.g. quote above)
- CASA approach is explicitly targetted at/arises from the contextual
- Research questions - what does this type of adoption and development look like?
  - What was the reality that drove the adoption of the CASA
  - What was the experience of using it
  - What issues did it arise
  - What was its future?
- Multi-method research to explore if and how the two existing CASA have been used
  - Quantiative studies of usage
  - Case study descriptions of development and spread
  - Interviews with key people (e.g. Galway, academics etc)
