title: Gatherers, weavers and augmenters
---
The presentation used our immediate challenge of migrating 1500+ course sites from Blackboard to Canvas to explore a broader and important challenge facing higher education. A challenge most recently expressed in the [Productivity Commission's "Advancing Prosperity" report](https://www.pc.gov.au/inquiries/completed/productivity/report) which includes recommendations to grow access to tertiary education while containing cost and improving quality.

## How to stretch the iron triangle?

It has been suggested that this challenge to maximise all three of cost efficiency, quality, and access (diversity & scale) is a key issue for higher education (Ryan et al, 2021). It has even been labelled the "Iron Triangle" because - unless you change the circumstances and conditions - if you improve one one or both of the other will inevitably deteriorate (Mulder, 2013, p. 99)

Leading to the questions we faced:
1. Why is it difficult to stretch the iron triangle (maximise cost efficiency, quality, and accessibility)?
2. What needs to change in order to stretch the iron triangle?

## Gatherers and weavers

Most of the work we were doing during the migration was gathering and weaving disparate strands of knowledge (in particular design and contextual knowledge), ways of knowing, and technologies (broadly defined). The following image is a metaphor for this work. It is based on the work of [Kathleen Stewart](https://www.kathleenstewart.net/), who has written extensively about the work of gathering and weaving.

Through this work we came to a new metaphor for the work we were doing in the LMS migration. A metaphor that applies more broadly to our "business as usual" work helping design, implement, and support learning and teaching environments and experiences. What we do is gather and weave diverse strands of knowledge, ways of knowing, and technologies (broadly defined) to create environments and activities that augment the learning and teaching experience. This includes a lot of contextual and design knowledge that guides how to effectively weave the strands together.

## Why is it hard to stretch the iron triangle?

Digital technology is often positioned as a key enabler for the task of improving efficiency and transforming quality. Digital technology is increasingly pervasive within the context in which we do this gathering, weaving, and augmenting. However, what we've found - especially in the context of the LMS migration - is that the available digital technologies are making it harder to stretch the iron triangle.  Why?

Our current experience is that none of those digital technologies are helping improve the efficiency and transforming the work we do - gathering, weaving and augumenting.
