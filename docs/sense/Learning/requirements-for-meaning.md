title: Requirements for meaning
---
An O'Reilly article on machine learning for designers quotes a 1970s education related book on what is required for meaning. In this context, the connection is being made to machine learning.  To know "all" requires engagement and exposure over time.

> Or, as the educational philosopher Patricia Carini said, “To let meaning occur requires time and the possibility for the rich and varied relationships among things to become evident.” [source](https://www.oreilly.com/learning/machine-learning-for-designers)

For me this links to the difference between telological and ateleological design. With telological design always limited in the time it has, but also because its methods don't rely on "rich and varied relationships". Some echoes of [[bricolage]]
