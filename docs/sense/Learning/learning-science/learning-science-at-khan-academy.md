# Learning Sciences at Khan Academy 

See also: [[learning]]

[Source](https://blog.khanacademy.org/an-introduction-to-learning-science-at-khan-academy/)

Focuses on three big topics 

- Mastery Learning

	Student continues to work on a skill until they are able to "consistently apply it across multiple problems before moving onto the next skill".   An example where a fixed schedule of topics can cause issues. Leading to gaps, which accumulate and cause issues.

- Practice with feedback

	Practice with feedback leads to greater learning. With much work done on the type of feedback that helps. 

- Motivation 

	Learning is hard, requires sustained effort, often to overcome obstacles. Mentions _Expectancy-Value Theory_ as a guide.
