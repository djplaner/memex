title: Epistemic Fluency

> Working on real-world problems usually requires the combination of different kinds of specialised and context-dependent knowledge, as well as different ways of knowing. People who are flexible and adept with respect to different ways of knowing about the world can be said to possess _epistemic fluency_. (Markauskaite & Goodyear, 2017, p. 1)

## Quotes

> Capable teacher-designers need to be able to draw together the right sets of tools, methods, ideas, data (design knowledge) for each circumstance, and they also need meta-level, strategic, knowledge that can guide them in deciding what kinds of knowledge, and ways of knowing, are most likely to help with the specific design problem at hand. Educational design often involves a high level of epistemic fluency – including an ability to find and use the most appropriate kind of knowledge for each part of the design task at hand (Goodyear 2015). Design typically involves a skilful appropriation and blending of different kinds of knowledge, drawn from a variety of sources. (Goodyear, Carvalho & Yeoman, 2021, p. 459)
