## Laurillard (2012)

Identifies the following collection of learning activities (with examples) as covering her Conversational Framework, support common theories of learning, and are commonly found throughout education.

| **Learning through** | **Conventional technology** | **Digital technology** |
| --- |  --- |  --- |
| Acquisition | Reading books, papers; Listening to teacher presentations face-to-face, lectures; Watching demonstrations, master classes. | Reading multimedia, websites, digital documents and resources; Listening to podcasts, webcasts; Watching animations, videos. |
| Inquiry | Using text-based study guides; Analyzing the ideas and information in a range of materials and resources; Using conventional methods to collect and analyze data; Comparing texts, searching and evaluating information and ideas. | Using online advice and guidance; Analyzing the ideas and information in a range of digital resources; Using digital tools to collect and analyze data; Comparing digital texts, using digital tools for searching and evaluating information and ideas. |
| Practice | Practicing exercises; doing practice-based projects, labs, field trips, face-to-face role-play activities. | Using models, simulations, microworlds, virtual labs and field trips, online role-play activities. |
| Production | Producing articulations using statements, essays, reports, accounts, designs, performances, artifacts, animations, models, videos. | Producing and storing digital documents, representations of designs, performances, artifacts, animations, models, resources, slideshows, photos, videos, blogs, e-portfolios. |
| Discussion | Tutorials, seminars, email discussions, discussion groups, online discussion forums, class discussions, blog comments. | Online tutorials, seminars, email discussions, discussion groups, discussion forums, web-conferencing tools, synchronous and asynchronous. |
| Collaboration | Small group project, discussing others' outputs, building joint output. | Small group project, using online forums, wikis, chat rooms, etc. for discussing others' outputs, building a joint digital output. |

The design elements she identifies from the conversational framework include:

- Access to the teacher’s concepts 
- The means to articulate their concepts and reflections on practice 
- Extrinsic feedback on questions or articulations of their concepts 
- A practice environment that facilitates their actions 
- Extrinsic feedback on their articulations of their actions 
- A modeling environment that elicits their actions 
- Intrinsic feedback on their actions from the model 
- Access to peers' concepts 
- The means to articulate their concepts and reflections on practice 
- Extrinsic feedback from peers on articulations of their concepts 
- Sharing practice outputs with peers 
- Access to peers' outputs as a model for their practice
