title: Concrete examples
---

Abstract concepts are harder to learn than concrete. Using concrete examples (in various ways) to complement abstract concepts helps improve learning.

Selecting concrete examples should be done with care, including

- Ensure concrete examples and abstract instructions are consistent.
- Novices often notice and remember surface details (particularly problematic in mathematics)

    Provide multiple examples to draw these out.

## Advice for students

- Collect examples used and search for more
- Link the idea being studied and each example seeking to understand how the example applies to the idea
- share examples with friends and explain them to each other
- creating your own examples is more helpful
- make sure your examples are correct
