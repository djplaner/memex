# Concrete examples



Abstract concepts are harder to learn than concrete. Using concrete examples (in various ways) to complement abstract concepts helps improve learning.

Selecting concrete examples should be done with care, including

- Ensure concrete examples and abstract instructions are consistent.
- Novices often notice and remember surface details (particularly problematic in mathematics)

    Provide multiple examples to draw these out.


## Advice for students

- Collect examples used and search for more
- Link the idea being studied and each example seeking to understand how the example applies to the idea
- share examples with friends and explain them to each other
- creating your own examples is more helpful
- make sure your examples are correct
