# Interleaving

- Switch between ideas during a study session. Don't study one idea for too long. 
- Go back over the ideas again in different orders to strengthen your understanding.
- Make links between different ideas as you switch between them. 
- Don't switch too often, or spend too little time on one idea 
- Interleaving wil feel harder than studying the same thing for a long time - but it is helpful
