Note: Figure created by Dr Sakinah Alhadad and Goksu Dines based on Zimmerman's sociocognitive framework of self-regulated learning.  It's actually a h5p item which includes more guidance summarised here

1. Identify the task
    - What is my task?
    - What am I being asked to do, or would like to do?
2. Understand the task
    - What do I already know that will help me with this task?
    - What else might I need to know?
3. Set goals and plan
    - What is my goal(s)?  
    - What would I like to achieve through this task/ actions?  
    - What’s my plan? What are the next steps I’ll need to take to reach these goals?  
    - What strategies should I use?
4. Apply strategies
   - How should I work to reach these goals?  
   - What progress am I making?
5. Reflect/adapt
    - How do I know whether my strategies were effective in reaching my goals?  
    - What would I change or do differently next time?


Pandero describes Zimmerman's model as containing the cyclical three steps:

1. Forethought
2. Performance or volitional control
3. Self reflection

But offers this table which suggests there is more to it.
