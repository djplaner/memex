title: Chunking learning
---
The basic idea is not ensure learners are presented information/learning in a way that fits with the capabilities of their brains/intelligences. Cognitive load theory ([not without it's problems](https://www.worklearning.com/2010/09/14/cognitive-load-theory-coming-under-withering-attacks/)) etc suggests that we can only deal with limited new information.

Moss (2020) outlines method to design a live stream lecture based on chunking. Dividing a lecture into smaller chunks to provide learners an opportunity to process information before moving onto the next lot.  The intent being to improve transfer into long term memory.

The model is

- Introduction - using a quiz for retrieval practice
- Teaching (where new content is delivered)
- Student activity - strengthening udnerstanding
- Teaching (where new content is delivered)
- Formative assessment - checking for understanding
- Teaching (where new content is delivered)
- Student activity - strengthening understanding
- Summary - recapping key ideas, connecting with real world and previous content
