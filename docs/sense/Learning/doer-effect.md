> The Doer Effect is the learning science principle that students who do practice as they read (learn by doing) have higher learning gains than those who only read.

> The Doer Effect has been the focus of both academic and industry research. Studies of interactive courseware
from Carnegie Mellon University’s Open Learning Initiative showed that students who did more interactive
activities had a learning benefit approximately six times that of reading text and three times that of watching
video. This study confirmed what most people understand: doing practice is good for learning.

> However, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) were able to show this relationship was not
coincidental; doing caused learning.2 Causal results are critical for educational research because we should
know with a high degree of certainty that the learning methods presented to students will be effective
for their learning.
