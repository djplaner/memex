- start planning early for exams and spread study over a longer period, rather than all at once 
- review information from each class, but not immediately after class - have a break 
- after reviewing information from a recent class, ensure you study older information
- review should not be just reading your notes, use other effective study strategies 
- forgetting information is good as it encourages you to engage in [[retrieval-practice]]
