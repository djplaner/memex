# Retrieval Practice 

See also: [[effective-learning-strategies]]

- put away class materials and write/sketch everything you know and then check
- take as many practice tests as you can, try making your own and swapping with friends
- make flash cards, especially moving beyond just definitions and thinking of links between ideas
- works best when performance is checked
- this is hard, work progressively 
- don't focus on just words and definitions, recall main ideas, their relationships and new examples
