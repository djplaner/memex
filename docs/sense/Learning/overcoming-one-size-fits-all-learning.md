[Blog post](http://info.alleninteractions.com/overcoming-one-size-fits-all-learning) touching on the problem of one-size-fits-all, de-contextualised learning approaches and offering a method for addressing the [[two-sigma-problem]] that relies on the learner.  

Illustrate this with an example from software training.

Not sure how this could be implemented.
