---
An intentional strategy where new information that makes connections with the new information and existing knowledge.

There are numerous methods of elaboration, not all are supported by research to improve learning.

- _elaborative interrogation_

    Students develop how/why questions about content they've covered and attempt to answer from what they've learned. Figuring out the questions are a form of elaboration.

- _self-explanation_

    As simple as students verbalising the steps in a process.


## Advice to students

- Ask yourself questions while you are studying about how things work and why, and then find answers in your class materials and discus
- As you elaborate, make connections between different ideas to explain how they work together. Take two ideas and think of ways they are similar and different. 
- Describe how the ideas you are studying apply to your own experiences or memories. As you go through your day, make connections to the ideas you are learning in class.
- Make sure you explanations are accurate. Don't overextend, always check.
- Work your way up to elaboration without looking at materials
