# Three principles for malleable software

The three principles are implemented in Wildcard. Wildcard is a browser extension that allows manipulation of web pages via a table/spreadsheet type interface.  Interesting application but somewhat limited. Also doesn't make use of web components which might be important.

1. Customisation by direct manipulation
2. Semantic wrappers
3. Decoupling data from applications
