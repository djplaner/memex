Wikipedia on [affordance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance)

> In [psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology), **affordance** is what the environment offers the individual. In [design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design "Design"), affordance has a narrower meaning, it refers to possible actions that an actor can readily perceive.

The Interaction Design Foundation answers [What are affordances?](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/affordances) in the context of design

> An affordance is what a user can do with an object based on the user's capabilities.

> As such, an affordance is not a "property" of an object (like a physical object or a User Interface). Instead, an affordance is defined in the **relation** between the user and the object: A door affords opening if you can reach the handle. For a toddler, the door does **not** afford opening if she cannot reach the handle.

> An affordance is, in essence, an **action possibility in the relation between user and an object**.

Norman (2002) 

> When affordances are taken advantage of, the user knows what to do just by looking: no picture, label, or instruction is required. Complex things may require explanation, but simple things should not. When simple things need pictures, labels, or instructions, the design has failed (p. 9)
