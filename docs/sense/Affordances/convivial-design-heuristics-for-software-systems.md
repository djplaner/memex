## Design heuristics (Kell, 2020)

Technical heuristics

- Value _reference_ over _definition_
- Value _linking_ over _containment_
- Beware fragile affordances
- Support referential structures, not (just) definitional structures
- Forget world domination
- Bring the outside in
- Do not create worlds
- ALl objects should appear in all spaces
- Say no to classical logic
- Implement porously, not portably
- Abstraction definition as a costly operation 
- Reasoning scales best when it's small
- Information guiding, not hiding

Social heuristics

- _Conviviality_ as both social and technical
- Exploiting irrationality
- Exploit the desire to own and to simplify


## Design principles (Voinea, 2018)

Argues that Illich has two axiological pillars

1. personal autonomy
2. social cohesion.

From which arises a minimal design criteria

First based on personal autonomy

1. Flexibility -  user can adapt the technology to their needs
2. Transparency - User should have knowledge of how the technology works. Argues this doesn't mean open source.
3. Simplifiability and usability - without expert guidance the user can discover how technologies can be best used and are free to improve and simplify the technology. The ability to choose only the features they need.

And another set on social cohesion

1. Sharedness - free to share the technology or results with anyone you see fit
2. Creativity - ability to tinker/hack/remix a technology and present it to others
3. Sociality - consider not just the good of the individual, but the good of the community and society as a whole. 

The intent is not that all software should be convivial, but an aim for "an equilibrium between convivial and non-convivial technologies""

> Free/libre open-source software is convivial because it is centered around the values of openness and free expression, while putting an emphasis on users' ability to understand how the artifact works by relying on a community of programmers, testers, translators and other digital enthusiasts. FLOSS fosters the values of cooperation and social cohesion, due to its being operated by a group which provides explanations and help on special forums and sites for users with less technical skill. (p. 76)

## Paper aims

Paper has two aims

1. Advance _systemism_ - an ontological framework that accommodates both agency and social structure, stressing that everything is a system or part of a system - because it is better suited for understanding the role of technologies in the formation of a good society  
2. Provide a matrix for the ethical design of technologies meant to foster conviviality
