# Education and the future of software freedom — GNU MediaGoblin

Talk presented at [libreplanet.org](https://libreplanet.org).

## Description

As the political stakes of digital technology become increasingly apparent, it’s clear that an ethical approach to software use and development is more important than ever. While a number of organizations and advocates are doing important work to advance ethical forms of software practice, we continue to miss one of the key sites where software habits and expectations are reinforced and normalized at scale, that is, institutions of education. In this talk, I will discuss the inadvertent role higher education plays in teaching students to passively accept broad forms of digital surveillance and control through its use of popular educational technologies like learning management systems, word processing software, and test taking tools, and how this submission leads to the broader mass helplessness in the face of current technological struggles. Starting with my chance encounter with free software as a humanities graduate student, I will highlight a range of promising contemporary examples of experiments in higher education that push against exploitative trends in educational technology and expose students to the differentiating value and possibility of software freedom. As we chart the course of the future of software, these examples shine light on the importance of educational institutions in the struggle for software freedom and the urgent need for broader community support to help sustain and encourage these precarious endeavors.
