# Foundations 



Random and very slowly emerging thinking about the foundations of my work/life (small l)

- Society is currently unfair and broken on many levels (gotta start with the pessimism)
- We can do so much better, but its an intractable/wicked problem
- Digital technology can't directly help, but used well it can make a contribution or at least not make it worse
- But society/industry is taking digital technology into the wrong direction
