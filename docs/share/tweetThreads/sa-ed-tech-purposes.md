Reading about "Distributed situation awareness" (DSA) https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021002465 (HT: @beerc) & pondering its utility in explaining apparent limitations with L&T #entangledPedagogy #tel. In particular, institutional tendencies toward shared, rather than compatible awareness.

Distributed situation awareness is "activated knowledge for a specific task within a system ....  use of appropriate knowledge (held by individuals, captured by devices, etc.) which relates to the state of the environment and the changes as the situation develops" 

--- 

Each agent's "awareness" varies based on their goals and tasks it's not possible for there to be **shared** awareness.  Instead, more useful to think of **compatible**󠁧󠁢󠁷  awareness. Compatible SA is seen as necessary for effective/efficient systems.

And performance depends on appropriate information for each agent at the right time.
