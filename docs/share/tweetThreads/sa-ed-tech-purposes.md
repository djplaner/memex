Reading about "Distributed situation awareness" (DSA) https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687021002465 (HT: @beerc) & pondering its utility in explaining apparent limitations with L&T #entangledPedagogy #tel. In particular, institutional tendencies toward shared, rather than compatible awareness. 

> Distributed situation awareness is "activated knowledge for a specific task within a system ....  use of appropriate knowledge (held by individuals, captured by devices, etc.) which relates to the state of the environment and the changes as the situation develops" 

Each agent's "awareness" varies based on their goals and tasks it's not possible for there to be **shared** awareness.  Instead, more useful to think of **compatible**󠁧󠁢󠁷  awareness. Compatible SA is seen as necessary for effective/efficient systems.

And performance depends on appropriate information for each agent at the right time.
