title: Consistency and UX
---
- Lots of people push for consistent course websites
- Some even cite UX principles as explicitly including consistency as justification 
- But they forget that the end goal of UX is to improve the user's experience (not consistency)
- Consistency is one of the principles to balance against other principles and the nature of the task  
- Now, if you think that the task is "finding information in a course website" you may have an argument 
- But that forgets that course websites are used for very different types of courses for different purposes 
- Key finding from educational research into scale, is....
- ...lead into the core problem is the UX experience of designing course sites...it's really crap and that's why you get crap websites 
- Maybe Ellis quote?
