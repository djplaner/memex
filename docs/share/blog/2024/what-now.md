# UNDER CONSTRUCTION

It's over a year since the last post to this blog. What I'm doing has changed and consequently what and how I leverage the Internet for [[]] needs to change. The following is an attempt to work through what that change might look like.

_TLDR_: ???

- What: Little or no attention to higher education with an increasing focus on the local flora, fauna, and post-work life.
- How: A move away from Wordpress and the blog "medium". Re-examination of hosting, in particular the current split between Reclaim Hosting ([personal domain](https://djon.es) and [this blog](https://djon.es/blog/)) and Github pages ([memex](https://djplaner.github.io/memex/)). Exploring integration with other tools and services (e.g. [eBird](https://ebird.org/home) and [iNaturalist](https://inaturalist.ala.org.au/)).

## Changes

A bit's changed in the last year. I lost a parent, ended my ~30 year career in tertiary education, and came to a joint decision with any prospective employers that full-time employment was not the direction for me. Since this blog arose out of and was largely focused on my employment in the university sector, the lack of activity is no surprise.

Raising some questions...

## What's next?

What's next for this blog? What's next for my personal domain? What's next for my online presence? What's next for my use of digital tools for sense making? What's next for me?

Divide those into two 

1. Purpose. 
2. Method.

## Purpose

## Method

1. [The social web](https://manuelmoreale.com/the-social-web)
2. [Indieweb vis Indie Web](https://fyr.io/post/indieweb_vs_indie_web)
3. [The slow web](https://www.jackcheng.com/the-slow-web/)
4. [The small web is beautiful](https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/)
5. [About smolweb](https://smolweb.org/index.html)
6. [Diagram website](https://diagram.website/)

[Wiki and blog authoring](https://mathewlowry.medium.com/two-wiki-authors-and-a-blogger-walk-into-a-bar-7106c8376c6e) - perhaps not so relevant
[Differences between blogs and wikis](https://idratherbewriting.com/2012/04/19/differences-between-blogs-and-wikis-and-why-you-might-need-both/) - positions blogs as being for current news/activity and wikis as long form. Blog posts are ephemeral? Not so sure That works. Memex is not a wiki.
