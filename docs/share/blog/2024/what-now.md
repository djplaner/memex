2024 passed without a post to this blog. Mainly because I've moved on from higher education and found myself taking an early retirement. Suddenly digital learning is not such a big part of my thinking. Hence the poverty of posts. Raising the question, what now? For this blog, the nature and approach to my online presence and engagement, and how I pass my time (not in that order).

*TLDR* 

My primary past-time will be the sustainable restoration of the native forests on our home block. I'm not convinced that Wordpress is the blogging tool I'll continue with. Not convinced that blogging is a practice I can maintain. Though I hope not to throw away the content and domain name here. If only to prevent nefarious actors from taking over the expired domain. As has happened with a couple of the higher education technology blogs/sites (e.g. [Mark's](https://www.slideshare.net/marksmithers)) I used to follow. I do want to leverage online to help with our restoration focus.

Hence, apart from some thinking aloud. This post is an opportunity for anyone still keeping an eye on this blog to understand the likely evolution.

- How: A move away from Wordpress and the blog "medium". Re-examination of hosting, in particular the current split between Reclaim Hosting ([personal domain](https://djon.es) and [this blog](https://djon.es/blog/)) and Github pages ([memex](https://djplaner.github.io/memex/)). Exploring integration with other tools and services (e.g. [eBird](https://ebird.org/home) and [iNaturalist](https://inaturalist.ala.org.au/)).

## Sustainable restoration as assemblage

A bit's changed in the last year. I lost a parent, ended my ~30 year career in tertiary education, and came to a joint decision with any prospective employers that full-time employment was not the direction for me. Since this blog arose out of and was largely focused on my employment in the university sector, the lack of activity is no surprise.

Raising some questions...

## Limitations of current digital practices

Wordpress and blogging

Mastadon and indieweb

## Possibilities moving forward

- "ecological" mastodon

## What's next?

What's next for this blog? What's next for my personal domain? What's next for my online presence? What's next for my use of digital tools for sense making? What's next for me?

Divide those into two 

1. Purpose. 
2. Method.

## Purpose

## Method

1. [The social web](https://manuelmoreale.com/the-social-web)
2. [Indieweb vis Indie Web](https://fyr.io/post/indieweb_vs_indie_web)
3. [The slow web](https://www.jackcheng.com/the-slow-web/)
4. [The small web is beautiful](https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/)
5. [About smolweb](https://smolweb.org/index.html)
6. [Diagram website](https://diagram.website/)

[Wiki and blog authoring](https://mathewlowry.medium.com/two-wiki-authors-and-a-blogger-walk-into-a-bar-7106c8376c6e) - perhaps not so relevant
[Differences between blogs and wikis](https://idratherbewriting.com/2012/04/19/differences-between-blogs-and-wikis-and-why-you-might-need-both/) - positions blogs as being for current news/activity and wikis as long form. Blog posts are ephemeral? Not so sure That works. Memex is not a wiki.
