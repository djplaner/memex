The following is a rationalisation/explanation of what's next for this blog, the site in general.

_TLDR_: ???

- Little or no attention to higher education. 
- _What will be the new focus_?
- Moving away from using Wordpress and the blog "medium"
- _What will be the new method_?

## What's been going on?

It's over a year since the last post to this blog. A bit's happened since then. I lost a parent, ended my ~30 year career in tertiary education, and came to a joint decision with any prospective employers that full-time employment was not the direction for me. Since this blog arose out of my employment in the university sector, the lack of activity is no surprise.

Raising some questions...

## What's next?

What's next for this blog? What's next for my personal domain? What's next for my online presence? What's next for my use of digital tools for sense making? What's next for me?

Divide those into two 

1. Purpose. 
2. Method.
