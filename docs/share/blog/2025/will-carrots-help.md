title: Will carrots help?

The following was sparked by Jason Lodge's LinkedIn post - [It's all sticks and no carrots in Australian higher education](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/its-all-stick-carrot-australian-higher-education-jason-m-lodge-poy3e/) - and Col Beer's response blog post - [Innovation where art thou?](https://beerc.wordpress.com/2025/09/09/innovation-where-art-thou/#respond). 

## All sticks and no carrots

Jason argues that the on-going increase in the compliance burden on Australian higher education (the stick) is leading to "a ballooning army of administrators" at the expense of learning and teaching roles focused on improving learning and teaching. Meaning L&T innovation is near impossible. This is especially important given the questions GenAI are asking about the very nature of knowledge, learning, teaching, and by implication the nature of higher education. 

The expectation that market forces will encourage effective innovation is seen as flawed. First, because education is not a commodity/product, it is a public good. Second, because the current context has most institutions in survival mode. A mode where compliance is the focus and innovation is off the agenda. All sticks and no carrots. 

Other factors make this especially problematic. Australia's national enablers of innovation within the higher education sector - national government funded bodies - have been dismantled. Leaving what innovation is happening to be sprinkled piecemeal within individual institutions leading to duplication. While at the same time other nations are investing in "systemic innovation in higher education, with a specific focus on leveraging AI to create a more effective and resilient system". The current perceived nature of GenAI is such that incremental innovation is not enough. Radical innovation is required.
