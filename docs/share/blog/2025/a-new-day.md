A new day dawns. A [planned technology migration](https://djon.es/blog/2025/01/12/what-now/) of my blog is complete. 

Goodbye to "big tech" Wordpress and its (IMHO) horrid authoring environment and bloated performance. Hello to a markdown based static site generated through Python and numerous open source tools. The blog is reasonably functionally complete, but tinkering will continue. After all, enabling tinkering was a key motivation for the migration. 

This post celebrates that move and is intended to:

1. introduce the new technology stack;
2. share the migration method;
3. help develop the authoring process;
4. reflect on the process; and,
5. document some initial ideas for next steps.

!!! note "Linking the stream and the garden"

    Many of the links below demonstrate a linkage between the ["garden and the stream"](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/). 
    
    This blog post is part of my stream. A serialisation of more complete ideas I'm sharing with others. 

    Many of the links below are to my [memex site](https://djon.es/memex). My garden of ideas. A space within which I iteratively develop, refine and share ideas in ways that are tentative and interconnected. A space where I document experiments and slowly grapple with ideas. Experiments like [[convert-wordpress-into-memex|converting my Wordpress blog to Markdown]]. 

## The new technology stack

### Content and authoring

The new blog is a collection of markdown files saved in a git repository (currently [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/djplaner/blog)). Content authoring is done via VSCode leveraging the [Foam extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=foam.foam-vscode). Foam is an assemblage of existing VSCode extensions configured to provide [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com) like functionality.

My approach to authoring is a little more complex, more below.

### Publishing the blog

The markdown files are converted into a collection of HTML files using [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). Material for MkDocs is a template (extension) of the Python based [MkDocs static site generator (SSG)](https://www.mkdocs.org). The HTML files are added to another git repository that is hosted on my personal web server and thus available to you.

MkDocs provides two different methods ([mkdocs-gen-files](https://oprypin.github.io/mkdocs-gen-files/index.html) and [mkdocs-macros-plugin](https://mkdocs-macros-plugin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) to further customise the generated HTML by writing your own Python code. For example,  the following simple table show statistics about the blog is generated by code I wrote using the mkdocs-macros-plugin. Initially, for us on the blog about page, but can be used anywhere in the blog. An example of what I've labelled [[computational-components]].

{{ blogStats() }}

### Serving the blog

As the published blog is just HTML, it is served by the standard web server (Apache) used by my hosting service.

## The migration method

The task of [[convert-wordpress-into-memex|converting my Wordpress blog to markdown]] worked through the following steps:

1. [[export-wordpress-to-markdown|Export]] the contents of the Wordpress blog to markdown.

    - Use Wordpress' in-built export functionality to download an XML file with all of the blog's content. 
    - Use [Wordpress export to Markdown](https://github.com/lonekorean/wordpress-export-to-markdown) to generate a structured collection of markdown files.
2. [[modify-markdown-files|Modify the markdown files]] to mirror the old blog structure, fix outdated content, and create blog functionality. 

    Markdown files were moved into a different directory structure that matched the old Wordpress blog structure. This was done to ensure that long-term URLs for blog posts stay the same. The content of the markdown files were modified to tidy up and correct outdated content (e.g. Slideshare links I now longer use, outdated links etc). Add to MkDocs' generic functionality support for blog functionality (e.g. category pages, archives, RSS feeds, comments/pingbacks) so additions to the [MkDocs static site generator (SSG)](https://www.mkdocs.org). All done using Python.
    
3. [[modify-interface|Tweak the SSG interface]] to better suit the design of my new blog.

    Mostly involving tweaking [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs) HTML and CSS templates.
4. [[comparing-wordpress-to-memex|Compare and refine]] the new blog against the old and expectations.

    Analyse the speed and accessibility of the new blog HTML to compare with Wordpress. Confirming it is faster, but not without some issues to address.
5. Replace Wordpress.

    Modify the the web server configuration to move the Wordpress blog to its [new location](https://djon.es/wordpress-blog) and replace it with [the new blog](https://djon.es/blog/).

## The authoring process

### The challenges

The original intent for this migration was to merge my stream (the blog) and garden ([memex](https://djon.es/memex/)). Meaning I could use the [Foam authoring process](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/#how-do-i-use-foam) on both. Sadly the size of my stream and garden exceeded the limitations of the VSCode extensions. In particular, the link autocompletion process which was taking tens of seconds to complete. Hence the kludge to keep the stream and garden in separate repositories.

With the blog in its own repository the basic Foam authoring process worked fine. However, there were two limitations.

1. Manually adding blog functionality; and,

    For example, each blog post contains next/previous links. Foam knows nothing about this. Meaning authoring a blog post would required manually calculating and adding the next/previous links.
2. No linkage with the garden (memex).

    The description of the migration process above includes direct links to the respective parts of the garden (memex). Foam makes such connections easy, but not if authoring is taking place in a different repository.

### The solution

The current authoring process involves:

1. Authoring (and edit) blog posts within the Memex repo.

    Leveraging Foams ability to create and maintain interconnected links.

2. Use a custom Python script to copy a blog post to the blog repo. 

    The script will: update content to fit within the blog repo (e.g. update internal memex links to full URLs); create/update the blog post's markdown file in the blog repo, and update the markdown file to add correct next/previous links.

## Reflections

### everything old is new again - static sites

Harking back to webfuse days

Svelte

### interoperability 

Shirky (2008) - "The web is a platform for interoperability". The blog is now a collection of markdown files that can be used in other contexts. For example, the blog posts are now available in my memex.

### Reusability paradox

Not something that anyone else could easily use. Assemblage to something that is specific to me. VS-Code, Foam, Python,

### House of cards

Technologies change. Perl > Python > Svelte > Python


## Next steps

- commenting feature

    - Tim's approach using mastodon etc.

- stats

- Reduce reliance on big tech (e.g. GitHub, VSCode)

- Improve the authoring process

    - Blog post links to Memex mirroring any changes in Memex

- More statistical [[computational-components]] similar to [this]((https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/archive/)
