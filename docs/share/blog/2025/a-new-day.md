A new day dawns. A [planned technology migration](https://djon.es/blog/2025/01/12/what-now/) of my blog is complete. Goodbye to "big tech" Wordpress and its (IMHO) horrid authoring environment and bloated performance. Hello to a markdown based static site generated through Python and numerous open source tools. 

Authoring this post marks a functionally complete blog. However, the tinkering will continue. This first post using the new assemblage is intended to:

1. share what was done and the results;
2. help develop the authoring process;
3. reflect on the process; and,
4. document some initial ideas for next steps.

## What was done

!!! note "Linking the stream and the garden"

    The links below demonstrate my attempt to link the ["garden and the stream"](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/). This blog is a stream. A serialisation of more complete ideas I'm sharing with others. My [memex site](https://djon.es/memex) is a garden. An iterative space within which I iteratively develop, refine and share ideas in ways that are tentative and interconnected. A space where I try to make sense of these ideas and use them for my own purposes. 
    
    Purposes like figuring out how to [[convert-wordpress-into-memex|convert my Wordpress blog]]. The remaining links in this section connect my work-in-progress on this activity.


The task of [[convert-wordpress-into-memex|converting my Wordpress blog]] into a markdown based static site involved the following steps:

1. [[export-wordpress-to-markdown|Export]] contents of the Wordpress blog to markdown.

    Use Wordpress' in-built export to download an XML file and then use [Wordpress export to Markdown](https://github.com/lonekorean/wordpress-export-to-markdown) to generate a structured collection of markdown files ready for the next step.
2. [[modify-markdown-files|Modify the markdown]] to mirror the old blog structure using the new technology stack.

    Starting by using custom Python scripts to tidy up and correct the markdown files due to outdated blog content (e.g. Slideshare links I now longer use) and other issues (e.g. various outdated links). Other Python scripts were used to modify the structure of the markdown files from the previous step to re-create the existing blog structure. Meaning that existing links to blog posts and pages would still work. Finally more Python scripts were used to generate additional blog functionality using [[computational-components]] (e.g. category pages, archives, RSS feeds, existing comments/pingbacks).
3. [[modify-interface|Tweak the interface]] provided by my static site generator to better suit the design of my new blog.

    Mostly involving tweaking the static site generator's ([Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs) HTML and CSS templates.
4. [[comparing-wordpress-to-memex|Compare and refine]] the new blog against the old and expectations.

    Speed, accessibility, and validation tests on the new blog to see if it was faster and better than the old. 
5. Replace Wordpress.

## Authoring process

The original intent was to merge the authoring of blog posts with the memex authoring process (see the [Foam authoring process](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/#how-do-i-use-foam)). Thereby better integrating the stream with the garden. Sadly the number of markdown files in the blog meant that the VSCode autocompletion process for links was really slow (tens of seconds). Hence I made the decision to blog and memex into separate repositories. That's one need to be addressed.

The other the additional functionality required of a blog. For example, links to the next and previous posts. As I've implemented my blog the next/previous links are added into the YAML frontmatter of the markdown files which is used by the static site generator to create the interface. Initially, the generation of these next/previous links was done by the Python script that imported the markdown files. Something similar needed to be done by the authoring process.

```sh
python util/updatePost.py --post <markdown file>
```


## Next steps

- commenting feature

    - Tim's approach using mastodon etc.

- stats

- Reduce reliance on big tech (e.g. GitHub, VSCode)

- Improve the authoring process

    - Blog post links to Memex mirroring any changes in Memex
