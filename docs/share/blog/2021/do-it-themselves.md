title: '"Do it themselves" and technology/purpose mismatch'

Or perhaps the "invisibility of purpose"

Mark Smiths makes some points about what he sees as the "sweet" spot distinction between Moodle and Canvas

There may be some that quibble with Mark's categorisation (I tend to agree) but that's not my focus here. Instead I'd like to dig into Mark's practice here of choosing a technology to match the "purpose" for which it is being used. In Mark's case he's suggesting the following alignment:

- Moodle fits better with the "purpose" of "learning designer and specialists work with an SME"
- Canvas fits better with the "purpose" of teaching staff (SMEs) doing all (the majority) of the work


## Related points

- Basic premise is that the technology has to fit your "purpose"
  - Functional evaluation of technology often misses the broader point
  - institutions don't think about the different costs/savings

## institutional purpose vs individual purpose

There's using technology for my learning, my teaching and an institution using technology in learning and teaching.

- e.g. Kevin and the DIY approach to getting rid of DLTS. - print too complex, tech easy enough

- But single systems don't make it easy, largely because they aren't single systems anymore
  - The rationale for enterprise **integrated** systems was easy to use but not longer single systems


- But what if your intitution does a bit of A and a bit of B (my tweet)
- Common solution appears to be seperate org units/OPM and/or separate systems

- CQU have used Moodle for a very specific learning design
  - But Moodle is flexible and with the right people can be modified

- The rise of Blackboard Ultra - at least a couple of years ago - a systems design for the (my interpretation) of the US higher education system where individual academics (often in each section) do their own thing
- Oz higher ed is no longer in that purpose - perhaps link to the broader trend to increasing number of professional staff and the reasons behing that as a driver for the purpose

## But technology is more than just hardware and software

Education is technology. Failure to see that is a problem?
