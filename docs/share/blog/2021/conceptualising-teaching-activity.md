title: Conceptutalising the complexity of teaching activity
---
Big picture thinking.

- Activity centered design - Don Norman - have a focus on the activity itself, not the student, nor the teacher, nor the technology, not the pedagogy.
- The activity - Goodyear - design for learning - is going to involve an entangled mess of all sorts of things HT "the scottish guy"
- Also Dron
- Conservation of complexity - Tesler's Law - the activity is becoming much more complex, much more entangled
- How to handle this - move away from outcomes/outputs to a focus on the activity
- generative - Gardner Campbell the odyssey project/domain of one's own - as something generative
- Activity systems - CASA
