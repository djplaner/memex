The practice of higher education - especially within contemporary Australian higher education - is inherently entangled. Entangled in the sense outlined by __what'is face and his stuff__ focused on the practice of individual learning and teaching. But much of what we talk about, practice, and seek to encourage doesn't recognise, let alone deal with this entanglement.

However, currently, I and an increasing number of other staff employed by contemporary higher education do not directly engage in the practice of individual learning and teaching. We're there to help those involved in the practice of individual learning and teaching. We're dealing with the engtangled nature of higher education at scale. IMHO, adding scale further complexifies the entanglement. Ensuring quality higher edcuation at scale is inherently entangled, but in different ways than individual practice. But much of what we talk about, practice and seek to encourage doesn't recognise, let alone deal with this entanglement.

My argument is - and has been for sometime (Jones and Clark, 2014) - that unless higher education recignoses and engaged with this entanglement then the quality of higher education will be limited. In particular, higher education has no hope of productively handling the Iron Triangle problem.

For example.
