The [last post](https://djon.es/blog/2020/08/01/pondering-if-and-how-hax-web-components-fit-in-blackboard/) document some early experiments with [the HAX magic script](https://dev.to/btopro/uwc-part-3-the-magic-script-122a) and its integration with [the Blackboard Learn LMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackboard_Learn). This included some ideas for further work using the magic script and web components with Blackboard. That post concluded that the HAX editor web component was probably too difficult to integrate with Blackboard due to my limited permissions with the institutional Blackboard.

This post demonstrates a workaround that enables the use of the HAX editor with Blackboard content items.
