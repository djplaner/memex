That _consistency is key in online learning_ is widely accepted in both practice and research. It's part of the title of Scutelnicu et al (2019). This discussion includes the topic [_Put down that shiny object_](https://wcet.wiche.edu/frontiers/2023/02/02/put-down-the-shiny-object/) and the common motivation for consistency - student feedback
> The most reported major struggle was focused around inconsistent layouts from course to course, which led to confusion.

Echoing [Phil Hill's report in 2019](https://philonedtech.com/student-panels-non-traditional-students-and-consistency-in-course-navigation/) from a session at Athabasca University
> Consistent message from student panels re online Ed: make it easy to navigate and find materials, don't make excuses \*Not\* an argument for carbon copy course designs 
Personally and a bit of a spoiler for the rest of this, I think Hill's point is better at diagnosing the problem and suggesting a solution. The problem students are facing isn't inconsistency, it's poor design. Consistency may be one way to address this issue, but it's not without its issues.

Perhaps the biggest is Hill's point about "carbon copy course designs". The core of my long-term (sometimes overly vehement) problem with institutional consistency. [Here's a quote from 1996](https://djon.es/blog/2015/02/25/contradictions-in-adjectives-you-cant-be-consistent-and-optimal/#and-its-not-new) quoting Mark (1990) on the tensions between standardised systems for production & distribution of courseware and the desire of teachers/designers to be creative and imaginative. Another from 2015 picking up on how the inherent diversity in a field like education significantly increases the tension between [consistency and both creativity and optimality](https://djon.es/blog/2015/02/25/contradictions-in-adjectives-you-cant-be-consistent-and-optimal/#consistent-cant-be-optimal) and a favourite Dede (2008) quote (first heard in a [Gardner Campbell 2009 talk](http://www.gardnercampbell.net/blog1/intuitions-networks-disruptions/)) 

> Educational research strongly suggests that individual learning is as diverse and as complex as bonding, or certainly as eating. Yet theories of learning and philosophies about how to use ICT for instruction tend to treat learning like sleeping, as a simple activity relatively invariant across people, subject areas, and educational objectives. Current, widely used instructional technology applications have less variety in approach than a low-end fast-food restaurant. (p. 58)

The aim here is to ponder some widely adopted solutions to this broad problem (templates and design systems). Identify and discuss their strengths and weaknesses and start exploring what might be beyond them. To seek if we're able to address the problems identified in the consistency discussion without forcing learning and teaching into the McDonald's consistency trap.

## Consistency and computer interfaces

Recognition of the importance of consistency in computing can be seen in the early days of the development of [Graphical User Interfaces (GUI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface). Before GUIs the interface used by most software was text only, often command line driven. Somewhat to very complicated to use. Much simpler to design. GUIs shifted this balance. They were much more complicated to design, especially well. But they were much simpler to use and supported more complex tasks, further increasing the design challenge. 

For me at least, the shift from classroom to online/digital learning and teaching environments echoes this shift.

[Larry Tessler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Tesler) was one of the early pioneers of GUI design. He worked at Xerox PARC where GUIs first emerged. Later he worked with Apple that did much of the early work mainstreaming GUIs. In [this interview](https://web.archive.org/web/20080223103732/http://www.designingforinteraction.com/tesler.html) he describes how the value of consistency was recognised and how it was supported in GUI development. Consistency was seen as a way to benefit both users (improving quality of the GUI and the user experience) and developers (reducing the time and complexity required to develop GUIs). 

The method for encouraging consistency at Apple in the early 1980s was the development of a generic application. A real program with all the typical features of a GUI (windows, menus, commands etc) but not specific functionality. A GUI developer developed their application by modifying this generic application. 

## Templates - generative or sterile?

Templates are the "generic application" of the contemporary digital L&T environment. Perämäki (2021) positions course templates as a framework for a course site to help the content creator/teacher. In this context, templates benefits are suggested to include reducing teacher workload, improving design decisions, and improving the student experience (Konstantinidis, 2022). Hill et al (2012) focus on templates as partially structured and populated that aid teachers getting started with course site design. In later related work (Fresen et al, 2014) three important assumptions about templates were identified.

1. A template's role is to suggest, not prescribe.
2. Templates can be mixed and matched, they're not mutually exclusive.
3. Templates should be supported with appropriate help materials, including suggestions for implementation and modification.

All of which very much echoes the generic application approach of Apple in the 1980s. The template provides the starting point for modification, not a carbon copy or cookie cutter. 

However, not all use of templates in digital L&T take this approach, nor are perceived this way. Scutelnicu et al (2019) identify the potential for teachers to see templates as a prescription and a threat to academic freedom. [Neil Mosley asks whether it is unreasonable](https://www.neilmosley.com/blog/freedom-and-the-lms) to require teachers to forego some freedoms around how they use an LMS in order to reduce the unnecessary friction in the student experience. Does the ends justify the means? What if it leads to conservations like that reported by Macfarlan and Hook (2022)?

    'Can I do X?' or 'How would I do Y?', until the ED said, 'You can do anything you like, as long as you use the template.' With a shrug the educator indicated their compliance. The ironic surrender was palpable.

This approach can arise from multiple sources, including:

- explicit design intent expressed in institutional policy - "you shalt use the template";
- oversight - "we didn't think anyone would want/need to"; and, 
- the limitations of the method/technology of implementation - "the tech doesn't allow you to change that (easily)".






## Design systems - good example, not necessarily activity focused

_stuff given to me by copilot_

Recent examples of this are the [University of Edinburgh's new website](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) and the [University of Glasgow's new website](https://www.gla.ac.uk/). Both are based on a common design system, and both are consistent in their use of the design system. The University of Edinburgh's new website is based on the [Edinburgh Design System](https://ed.ac.uk/brand/design-system), and the University of Glasgow's new website is based on the [Glasgow Design System](https://www.gla.ac.uk/brand/design-system/).


## Minimal set of activity systems - learning from RPA and citizen development - participatory

_Maybe where the Fawns et al stuff comes in _
