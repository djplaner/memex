# Learning & Teaching tools - some missing flavours

## Introduction

- Laurillard quote about the need for custom tools
- Lots of tools out there, even getting problematic managing them

- But some missing flavours - take a look at Canvas community for a taste that there are issues
- focus here is on identify abstractly what is missing, not why it is missing (questions for another time)

!!! Tools > software

    By tools I mean more than software. Templates, Sways, Workshops, checklists all the artefacts designed to help improve the quality of learning and teaching.

| Missing Flavour | Current state | What's missing |
| --- | --- | 
| Short arc |  Long arc | 
| Forward oriented design | Design for learning | 
| Scale by ?? | Scale by ?? |
| Usable and useful | Not so usable or useful |
