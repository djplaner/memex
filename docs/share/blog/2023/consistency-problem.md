University course sites (and probably the entire online experience) has a [findability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Findability) problem. The challenge for universities is how to sustainably solve this at scale. Consistency and templates are the increasingly common solution. Solutions that tend to be based on a very specific understanding of scale. An understanding that doesn't fit with the broader educational literature on scale. Examining that literature on scale suggests some alternate ways forward, but also some challenges getting there.

== The findability problem

Students find it difficult to find their way easily and purposefully through the maze of technologies and tasks in contemporary higher education. A point made in a recently shared piece by [Brandon Karcher](https://twitter.com/Karch10k) - [_Put down that shiny object_](https://wcet.wiche.edu/frontiers/2023/02/02/put-down-the-shiny-object/). A piece that included
> The most reported major struggle was focused around inconsistent layouts from course to course, which led to confusion.

Echoing [Phil Hill's report in 2019](https://philonedtech.com/student-panels-non-traditional-students-and-consistency-in-course-navigation/) from a session at Athabasca University
> Consistent message from student panels re online Ed: make it easy to navigate and find materials, don't make excuses \*Not\* an argument for carbon copy course designs 

Karchar's piece offers three considerations, including one for consistency and templates
> Consider and embrace consistency for the sake of students. As a direct result of our student feedback, we developed Moodle templates in collaboration with campus leaders among the faculty and have had very positive feedback, especially from new faculty.

[_Findability_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Findability) - the ease with which you can find what you need - is important. There is research that found findability to be the only significant predictor of both student motivation and self-efficacy (Simunich et al, 2015; Crews et al, 2017)


== The scale problem

Higher education's [_findability_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Findability) problem is entangled with higher education's _scale_ problem with learning and teaching. How do you sustainably improve the quality of learning and teaching across the entire institution? 

The "consistency" discussion has long identified _academic freedom_ as an issue. A comment on Hill's post points to a 2007 blog post reporting on a panelist identifying 
> the cottage model of online course development where the faculty member is responsible for the development of the electronic course content, which leads to an inconsistent student experience
More recently, [Neil Mosley talks about](https://www.neilmosley.com/blog/freedom-and-the-lms) the struggle universities have "drawing the line between recommendation and compulsion" and whether compelling someone to use a template to provide a more consistent student experience "is an abhorrent curb of their freedom and individual autonomy"?

Academic freedom is one of the reasons most university L&T Centres find themselves using "elective, selective, and exemplary approaches" (Bain & Zundans-Fraser, 2017, p. 12) to influence L&T. Approaches that are unlikely to work at scale (Bain & Zundans-Fraser, 2017; Ellis & Goodyear, 2019). Another challenge is resourcing. While most universities offer design support services the combination of high demand and limited resources mean that many academics are left to their own devices (Bennet, Agostinho & Lockyer, 2017)

Which brings us to the practice of consistency, templates, levels of compulsion and scale.

## Templates, consistency and the cookie cutter

Consistency and templates are suggests that have spread wide in higher education. As with everything in higher education there is diversity. Templates can range from opt-in to must-use. With the latter - edging toward Hill's carbon copy course designs - appear to be growing in prevalence. Templates can aim to encourage consistent navigation, or they can tend to be more encompassing, leading to the following exchange 
> until the ED said, 'You can do anything you like, as long as you use the template.' With a shrug the educator indicated their compliance. The ironic surrender was palpable. That shrug gave the ED pause. (Macfarlan & Hook, 2022)

Regardless of the level of compulsion involved, the application of consistency and templates generate issues, for example,

- A step beyond disciplinary content knowledge.

    An early 1990s distance education style guide specifying "single quotes shall not be used" leading to the practice of all single quotes in print study guides being replaced. Problematic if the study guide contains excerpts of code from the Prolog programming language. A language where single quotes are part of the syntax.

- Low floor becomes a low ceiling.

    An institution introducing a consistent navigation structure for course sites, including a pre-defined menu item for _Assessment_ to a single page design to include scaffolds to enable the provision of effective assessment information. A scaffold unable to deal with already more detailed and effective approaches already used over years in some courses. In seeking to provide a low floor (easy to get started) the institution had created a low ceiling (making more advanced approaches difficulty, if not impossible) without even considering the value in wide walls (providing multiple pathways from floor to ceiling) (see Resnick & Silverman, 2005; [Resnick, 2020](https://mres.medium.com/designing-for-wide-walls-323bdb4e7277)).

## A Typology of Scale

There is a lack of conceptual clarity around scale (Morel et al, 2019). Scale does not mean just consistency. The following table summarises Morel et al's (2019) scale typology. 

| Scale conceptualisation | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Adoption | Widespread use of an innovation - market share. Limited conceptualisation of expected use.|
| Replication | Widespread implementation with fidelity that will produce expected outcomes. |
| Adaptation | Widespread use of an innovation that is modified in response to local needs. | 
| Reinvention | Intentional and systematic experimentation with an innovation. Innovation as catalyst for further innovation. |

## Scaleable education innovations need to scale by being flexible

Dede's argument about scale and diversity, and the need for evolution


## How to fix templates?

Maybe this is where Dron's "small hard tools" -- templates are too big

perhaps back to our principles, framed as questions - maybe the CASA principles

1. How much additional value/functionality does the template provide? How much rework?
2. How much on-going change and reponsiveness is built in? Is it generative?
