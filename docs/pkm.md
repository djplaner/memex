The original primary purpose of this site was [personal knowledge management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management). In particular, drawing heavily on ideas from Harold Jarche's [Seek > Sense > Share](https://jarche.com/pkm/) approach to PKM (see [[seek-sense-share]] for more). A structure that served me reasonably well for working in academia. It could still work in retirement, but I'm not likely to be (anymore) sufficiently disciplined, especially the explicit sharing of artifacts.
