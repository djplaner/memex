The original primary purpose of this site was [personal knowledge management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management). In particular, a form that resolved around the three tasks of seek, sense, and share. A structure that served reasonably well for working in academia. It could still work but I'm not likely to be sufficiently disciplined, especially the explicit sharing of artifacts.
