## Podcasts - need to reflect

### [Jim Rut Show](https://www.jimruttshow.com/) - [Currents 095](https://www.jimruttshow.com/currents-matt-welsh/): Matt Welsh on the End of Programming

An ex-Harvard Professor (computer science) now working on AI start ups chats with a retired CEO, complexity, talented AI tinkerer (etc) initially about how AI will end programming, but really don't say a lot convincing about that point. Rather engage in a broader conversation that is interesting in terms of current thinking and practice around leveraging LLMs for different applications.

[CACM article](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2023/1/267976-the-end-of-programming/fulltext) which sparked the conversation

Welsh, M. (2022). The End of Programming. *Communications of the ACM*, *66*(1), 34--35. <https://doi.org/10.1145/3570220>

### [Mr Barton Maths Podcast](http://www.mrbartonmaths.com/podcast/) - [#166](https://www.mrbartonmaths.com/blog/tools-and-tips-for-teachers-1/) - Tools and Tips for Teachers: Episode 1

Two experienced mathematics teachers (one Oz, one Pom) and podcasts each bring three "tools and tips" and have a conversation. Linking them to broader ideas.

- Significant emphasis on cognitive/learning science informed practice 
- Mini-whiteboards as a tool for checking for understanding 
- References to people that might be interesting
