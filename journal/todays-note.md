# Today's note 

Attempt to start a daily to do list as a way of working. 

All current to dos are listed here.  When they are complete, they are moved into a daily note - at the end of the day preferably. Along with re-organising today's note. 

## Work 

- **Check migration progress and starting moving**
- Joined courses for T2
  - Have they been created 
  - Ask if staff want separate assignments for each course
- **Make sense of the following and integrate into Henry's ABC work**

	Zalavra, E., Papanikolaou, K., Dimitriadis, Y., & Sgouropoulou, C. (2022). Representing learning designs in a design support tool. *Education and Information Technologies*. <https://doi.org/10.1007/s10639-022-11441-6>

## Personal 

- Ask for referral to public for health 
- **Order floor mat and slippers**

## Seek 

- learn more about [[prompt-engineering]]
- Explore if Svelte kit starter can be adapted for user script development

### Reading

- [Design unbound](https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/kvwoCL7rMYcPA4GkESqv3Xl?domain=ebookcentral-proquest-com.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au)
- [The Unpredictable Abilities Emerging From Large AI Models](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-unpredictable-abilities-emerging-from-large-ai-models-20230316/)

## Sense 

- selective/elective/prescriptive/reductive/generative (abductive?) - framework for L&T interventions
- Executable versions of [[number-scrabble]] - various limited python versions
- Reflect on experience of [[implementing-number-scrabble]] through [[prompt-engineering]]
- Svelte development 
  - Design [[number-scrabble]] using Sveltekit - refine understanding of Svelte kit 
- Make sense of how Shane's complexity leadership work can inform Col's PhD work (and my own practice)
