- Notes from yesterdays uplift projects
- "course profile" bridging
- Rubric resources

- [Value sensitive design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_sensitive_design) 
    A potential method for research around L&T, but perhaps it is still led by design folk? Rather than enabling de-centralised design - anyone can design.

- [DeepLearning LangChain for AI App development](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/langchain/lesson/1/introduction)
 
## Mathematics

- [Undersatnd math learning area](https://v9.australiancurriculum.edu.au/teacher-resources/understand-this-learning-area/mathematics)


### Memex
  - Get a different theme up and going
  - home page 
    - add about
    - improve visual design of overlays (colour?)
    - some way to indicate count down for next image?

- Presentations 
  - [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) and [reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md) - options for markdown presentations

- Canvas 
  - Ask about git repo (or implement one) for macros 

- Hax
  - [edtechjoker](https://oer.hax.psu.edu/bto108/sites/edtechjoker/) - web components course - [[hax-as-casa]]
  - Figure out if/how to just embed hax components in Wordpress, memex, and perhaps Canvas
  - Hax editor as LTI for Canvas e.g. [icon](https://ranga-auaha-ako.github.io/canvas-icons/) (Svelte and SvelteKit) - and [code here](https://github.com/Ranga-Auaha-Ako/canvas-icons) and lots of other stuff.

FLOSS - driver

- Yori Benkler - Wealth of Networks (Zotero)


Possible
- Digital Transformation
- Consistency spiel and problems for Julie
- Start develop the "BAD" approach to L&T as a MLP
- educational design as more coding than software development - not enough over time consideration (software development as "coding over time")
- Start mapping the con courses for Henry explore if/how a CSDM and CM would work
- Check migration progress and starting moving
- Reach out to Peter
- **Make sense of the following and integrate into Henry's ABC work**

## Personal 

- Ask for referral to public for health 
- **Order floor mat and slippers**

## Seek 

- learn more about [[prompt-engineering]]
- Explore if Svelte kit starter can be adapted for user script development
- Explore questions of consistency in UX design missing the point that the bigger purpose of UX is to solve the user's problem

### Reading

- [Design unbound](https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/kvwoCL7rMYcPA4GkESqv3Xl?domain=ebookcentral-proquest-com.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au)
- [The Unpredictable Abilities Emerging From Large AI Models](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-unpredictable-abilities-emerging-from-large-ai-models-20230316/)

## Sense 

- selective/elective/prescriptive/reductive-exclusionary/generative (abductive?) - framework for L&T interventions
- Executable versions of [[number-scrabble]] - various limited python versions
- Reflect on experience of [[implementing-number-scrabble]] through [[prompt-engineering]]
- Svelte development 
  - Design [[number-scrabble]] using Sveltekit - refine understanding of Svelte kit 
- Make sense of how Shane's complexity leadership work can inform Col's PhD work (and my own practice)

- Share Collections witht he Canvas community site
  - Figure out Canvas community section to post to [blog](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Community-Hub/bg-p/communityblog-board), [Advice on writing](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Community-Hub/A-Blog-About-Blogging/ba-p/497368), [more advice](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Community-Hub/Do-You-Blog-A-Guide-to-Blogging-in-the-Canvas-Community/ba-p/469832)
