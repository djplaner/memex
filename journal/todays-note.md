- [Value sensitive design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_sensitive_design) 
    A potential method for research around L&T, but perhaps it is still led by design folk? Rather than enabling de-centralised design - anyone can design.

### Memex
  - Get a different theme up and going

Possible
- Digital Transformation
- Consistency spiel and problems for Julie
- Start develop the "BAD" approach to L&T as a MLP
- educational design as more coding than software development - not enough over time consideration (software development as "coding over time")
- Start mapping the con courses for Henry explore if/how a CSDM and CM would work
- Check migration progress and starting moving
- Reach out to Peter
- **Make sense of the following and integrate into Henry's ABC work**

## Personal 

## Seek 

- Explore if Svelte kit starter can be adapted for user script development
- Applications to mathematics pedagogy of Python, mindtools
- Explore questions of consistency in UX design missing the point that the bigger purpose of UX is to solve the user's problem

### Reading

- [Design unbound](https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/kvwoCL7rMYcPA4GkESqv3Xl?domain=ebookcentral-proquest-com.libraryproxy.griffith.edu.au)
- [The Unpredictable Abilities Emerging From Large AI Models](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-unpredictable-abilities-emerging-from-large-ai-models-20230316/)

## Sense 

- selective/elective/prescriptive/reductive-exclusionary/generative (abductive?) - framework for L&T interventions
- Executable versions of [[number-scrabble]] - various limited python versions
- Reflect on experience of [[implementing-number-scrabble]] through [[prompt-engineering]]
- Svelte development 
  - Design [[number-scrabble]] using Sveltekit - refine understanding of Svelte kit 
- Make sense of how Shane's complexity leadership work can inform Col's PhD work (and my own practice)
