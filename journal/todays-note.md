# Today's note 

Attempt to start a daily to do list as a way of working. 

- convert to thesis to Word doc for annotation and comment

- ditto ontologies and networks stuff

Prep 

- explicit teaching, explicit instruction and beyond
- Check out interview questions - practice, refine
- behaviour management (some done)
- differentation (some done)
- questioning
- mathematical misconceptions

[Why I’m banning AI](https://woborders.blog/2023/08/23/why-im-banning-ai/) – blog post - could be useful in terms of arguments for HLSS courses explaining why reliance on LLMs is to be avoided (e.g. "_unlearning_ commonly circulated misinformation and misunderstanding)

## Mathematics

Cathy Humphreys and Ruth Parker (Humphreys & Parker, 2015) and another by Sherry Parrish (Parrish, 2014), illustrate many different number talks to work on with secondary and elementary students, respectively

See also - [number talks](https://www.youcubed.org/category/teaching-ideas/number-sense)

> As I mentioned in Chapter One, the PISA team at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) not only give mathematics tests to students but also collect data on students’ mindset beliefs and mathematics strategies. From looking at the strategies the 13 million students use, the data show that the lowest-scoring students in the world are those who use a memorization strategy.

### Memex
  - Get a different theme up and going
  - [mkdoc template](https://github.com/Jackiexiao/foam-mkdocs-template) - using mkdocs roam links plugin
  - home page 
    - add about
    - improve visual design of overlays (colour?)
    - some way to indicate count down for next image?

- Presentations 
  - [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) and [reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md) - options for markdown presentations

  - Ask about git repo (or implement one) for macros 

- Hax
  - [edtechjoker](https://oer.hax.psu.edu/bto108/sites/edtechjoker/) - web components course - [[hax-as-casa]]
  - Figure out if/how to just embed hax components in Wordpress, memex, and perhaps Canvas
  - Hax editor as LTI for Canvas e.g. [icon](https://ranga-auaha-ako.github.io/canvas-icons/) (Svelte and SvelteKit) - and [code here](https://github.com/Ranga-Auaha-Ako/canvas-icons) and lots of other stuff.

Possible
- Digital Transformation
- Consistency spiel and problems for Julie
- Start develop the "BAD" approach to L&T as a MLP
- educational design as more coding than software development - not enough over time consideration (software development as "coding over time")
- Start mapping the con courses for Henry explore if/how a CSDM and CM would work
- Check migration progress and starting moving
- Reach out to Peter
- **Make sense of the following and integrate into Henry's ABC work**
